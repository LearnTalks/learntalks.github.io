Even worse, location services APIs often feel like black boxes, leaving even experienced developers scratching their heads how to debug them. So how does it all actually work? How can your phone, solely using the position of a few satellites, figure out where you are to within a few meters? How, dare we ask, is the location technology sitting in our pockets indebted not only to the Cold War but to the navigational needs of 18th century sailors?

Autolayouts are here to solve complex relations between UI objects and make a robust UI that will hopefully require less maintenance with the introduction of new device form factors.MotivationAutolayouts first appeared in iOS 6 and XCode 4.6. They constituted a big change in interface design. A complex set of rules was introduced for UI implementation. Let’s be honest, this was not a good start since Interface Builder at the beginning was trying to be smarter than the developer and was modifying the designs in an often unwanted way.The programatically applied interfaces have been introduced as the alternative to IB, but the NSLayoutConstraint’s lengthy method constraintWithItem: scares many programmers and the ASCII­art from constraintsWithVisualFormat: gives a headache at the first glance.The issues with IB are pretty much in the past. It’s now way easier to create desired constraints and debug them in the XCode 5.0+. Open source programmers have not been lagging behind and we can now find libraries helping with the interface design in code.During my daily work I can see that the Autolayout is being more and more used in the interface design, but when it comes to dynamic changes in the interface (and animations in particular) many programmers revert to the “comfort zone” of pixels and frames. All that can obviously be done using autolayouts, easier than you might have thought.The TalkI’ll show how to create layouts that adjust to both iPhone and iPad design and respond adequately to the changing content.I’ll present how to interpret and fix warnings and errors that are presented in the Interface Builder. I’ll show when and how to create and manipulate autolayout constraints in code and create fun animations.I’ll introduce the Lyt library (https://github.com/robotmedia/Lyt).As an addition I’ll also introduce the NibWrapper library for modular interface design that plays very well with Autolayouts (https://github.com/mobilejazz/NibWrapper). +info: https://github.com/mobiosis/NSSpain-autolayout-test","link":"/NSSpain/2014/NSSpain-2014-NSSpain-2014-Autolayout-for-everyone-by-Krzysztof-Kucharewicz/"},{"title":"NSSpain 2014 Interview with Enric Enrich and Jaime Paulo","text":"NSSpain Interview: Enric Enrich and Jaime Paulo","link":"/NSSpain/2014/NSSpain-2014-NSSpain-2014-Interview-with-Enric-Enrich-and-Jaime-Paulo/"},{"title":"All the [tech] world's a stage - Michele Titolo","text":"Creativity, collaboration, and ever-more-complex technology.

Coordinators are objects that control flow in an app. Coordinators are typically initialized with a navigation controller, although they can manage other types of view controllers as well. View controllers are totally transparent to coordinators; view controllers display data as directed by their coordinator and bubble up events as delegate methods, which the coordinators respond to. This makes reusing view controllers completely trivial, since the view controller doesn’t bring any baggage along with it. Much like views and view controllers, coordinators are found in a tree structure. The root coordinator is called the app coordinator, and contains the code for setting up the root view controller, which you might typically find in an app delegate. Swapping out app coordinators could change your app from an iPad layout to an iPhone layout. When a coordinator begins doing too many tasks, those tasks can be pushed down into a child coordinator. Complexity can easily be managed, and it has space for growth. The using the coordinator model is a simpler way of managing iOS apps and is a great tool for slimming down large view controllers.

Unless, of course, you want to do some nasty hacks with custom built openssl libraries. Unfortunately, the Security framework is not well documented, isn’t specially developer friendly, and has not been thought to interact with 3rd parties, such as external servers making use of standard public key infrastructures and libraries such as OpenSSL. However, nowadays, it’s a common requisite for our apps to interact with secure backends and RESTful APIs making use of asymmetric cryptography, KPIs or public key systems. In this presentation, I will explain how to make your iOS application interact with these external public key infrastructures, importing keys from external entities (probably generated via OpenSSL) and exporting the keys generated at the device so they can be used in signature and verification operations externally. –Recorded and produced live by Stefan Völker.NSSpain 2017.","link":"/NSSpain/2017/NSSpain-2017-Asymmetric-Cryptography-Between-iOS-and-the-Rest-of-the-World-Ignacio-Nieto/"},{"title":"Building Buddybuild - Dennis Pilarinos","text":"Building iOS apps is difficult enough, without having to worry about building your build system as well.

We’ll start with a walkthrough of the history and state of the art of iOS IDEs and related developer tools (developer-friendly text editors, git clients, terminal emulators, etc.). You’ll learn how Playgrounds.app works and what special rules it takes advantage of. We’ll go through the AppStore rules for developer tools, and what changed recently to allow more powerful IDEs. We’ll imagine how an IDE could look like on a multitouch device with new UIs and interactions, and what iOS 11 features we can leverage. A key feature of an IDE is executing code.

Many of the newer architectures are actively trying to replace existing coding practices that Apple continues to actively promote to developers and is implementing them in new APIs on the platform. In this talk I want to present an approach that doesn‘t replace anything - it embraces and builds on top of existing iOS API patterns. I will use an example (open-source) live app that shows: what’s the correct way to use MVC how to efficiently use DI (Dependency Injection) to properly transfer input data/configuration throughout the apphow and when to use Delegate pattern where and how to use Coordinators to manage data flow and display VCs, with minimum amount of boilerplate code where do components like network and API wrappers fit into the app how to create single point of data source for any other component in the app how to persist data in such a way that you can easily replace all of it with something else (say switch from Core Data to Realm) Each of the components is loosely coupled with the rest, each component does not care about the rest of the app. This separation of concern leads to easier testing, simpler maintainance and large degree of freedom to change data flow or even completely replace certain parts.

Abstract - When developing an iOS application, you rarely do not use libraries or framework.We use OS provided frameworks such like UIKit and Swift standard libraries. We also use useful third-party libraries.aAt the same time, everyone may have suffered from link errors, duplicate symbols, weird error messages from package managers.It is difficult to solve link errors because the cause of the problem comes from various things such as project setting, the library is static or dynamic, distribution method of the library or execution environment (on device or simulator). Learning the mechanism of the link makes you possible to solve the problems. In this talk, I will explain about a library and framework which can be used for iOS applications and explain the mechanism of how external libraries will be linked with your applications.

He sometimes brings the good parts of languages like Scala, Haskell or OCaml to Swift. Abstract - The protocol only handle existensial type like associateType. For some protocol, when we give some functions in protocol extension, we must put a concreate type. Protocol extension will work like searching function based on type, so it’s needed concreate type in somewhere. For example, for some type called A, sometimes we want to write extension using List[A] finaly.

Abstract - This is a talk about some of the hurdles faced when writing a simple Ray Tracer from scratch, using Swift.Ray Tracing is the cornerstone of Pixar’s infamous Renderman 3D rendering technology, which dominates the animated film industry. It works by physically modeling light rays and their interactions with objects and surfaces. Within recent years there has been a renewed interest in real time Ray Tracing, with the advent of more powerful and specialized hardware such as NVIDIAs RTX. Even renowned programmer John Carmack has stated that “”all roads lead to Rome””, when asked about the future of real time computer graphics and Ray Tracing. While I enjoy working with traditional graphics rasterizers, I have always been interested in physically modeling light, and have wanted to learn more about the processes involved. Here I talk about how I programmed a Ray Tracer that renders a simple scene from first principles. Given the timing, it also seemed like the perfect opportunity to test the versatility of Swift.

Swift Tokyo Conference 2019 - try! Swift is an immersive community gathering about Apple Technologies, Swift Language Best Practices, Application Development in Swift, Server-Side Swift, Open Source Swift, and the Swift Community in Tokyo! Topic - Introduction to Swift KeypathsSpeaker - Benedikt Terhechte Twitter - https://twitter.com/terhechte Bio - Benedikt works as a Senior iOS Developer at the professional network XING. In previous jobs he developed solutions for customers such as Disney or Daimler-Chrysler. As an Indie Mac developer, he launched successful apps such as PhotoDesk and Hirundo. Benedikt started investigating Swift right after the 2014 release and writes about it on his popular blog. He also initiated the Core Value and SourceKittenDaemon open source projects Abstract - Keypaths were added in Swift 4. They’re a fantastic feature but sometimes it feels difficult to find good situations for using them. However, when understood and used the right way, keypaths allow you to implement additional abstractions into your codebase that would be much harder with generics or protocols. In order to be able to do that, though, it is useful to intuitively understand when to apply the Keypath pattern. This talk will first explain the different types of keypaths that exist and then go through real world examples to showcase how they can be leveraged in your own projects.
