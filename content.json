Boolean state variables are the enemy of clean code. It starts with one variable to represent if something is connected or not. But there will probably be a dozen or more methods that need to check that variable, so now your code is dependent on it. New variables will emerge – with conflicting reasons for why each one should be set to true or false. The web of state gets tangled very quickly. Keeping code clean is just more fun with enums. Enum cases can contain associated values, so your state variables are always available in the context where they are most relevant. And because enums can have method implementations and protocol conformances in Swift, all of your state checking and branching can happen right there in the enum itself! I want this to be a talk that everyone can learn something from – and a focused topic like enums with very useful examples is what makes that possible. You should read the Swift language chapter on enums for how they work, and come to this talk for inspiration on where and when to use them!","link":"/360-Conferences/2018/360-Conferences-2018-Conrad-Stoll-Enumerating-The-Reasons/"},{"title":"Dan Kim - The Future of Our Community, is You","text":"Every day each one of us turns to community contributions to help us become better developers — blog posts, open source projects, conference talks, podcasts, and so much more.

You have seen them, and so your users. Thanks to EmojiCompat, now Android developers have a way to provide Emoji compatibility for older devices, but does it solve all the issues developers have with Emoji? Have you wondered why Twitter counts characters differently depending on the Emoji? Or how gender and skin tone Emoji modifiers work? How can I have a similar functionality as Slack on my app with custom Emoji? Do all your users see the same Emoji? On this talk, you will learn about the different pitfalls developers face when working with Emoji, like code points, the Fitzpatrick modifiers, and short-names, you will learn how to use EmojiCompat and I will show you alternatives to it. In this talk you will learn:– What are the problems developers face with Emoji– How Emoji works– How to use EmojiCompat including dynamic font downloading– What is EmojiCompat not solving, and what can you do– What alternatives are there to EmojiCompat– ..and of course everything with Kotlin!

Any good solution has to gracefully handle errors, cancellation, chaining multiple actions together, handle thread swapping, and much more. Kotlin’s coroutines are yet another option for asynchronous programming. However, unlike other popular contenders, coroutines meet all the previously mentioned requirements out-of-the-box, have a gentler learning curve, and don’t require you to write an absurd amount of boilerplate. That said, learning any new asynchronous solution takes time and often comes with a period of trial-and-error until you have all the nuances figured out. Get a jumpstart on coroutines: (1) Lessen the learning curve by getting the subtleties of coroutines out of the way early(2) Learn how to work coroutines into an existing app: easy places to start transitioning, interop with existing libraries, and reusing existing threading constructs(3) Learn how to easily support error handling, cancellation, and task chaining(4) Learn how to unit test coroutines Get a head start on coroutines in your apps and easily write, test, and maintain asynchronous code like never before!","link":"/360-Conferences/2018/360-Conferences-2018-Nick-Capurso-Kotlin-Coroutines-An-Intro-to-Practical-Use-on-Android/"},{"title":"Nick Cruz - Achieving Concurrency in RxJava","text":"RxJava is an incredibly nice library that lets us take our data on a journey through network calls, databases, UI threads and background threads.

With single-digit market-share, it felt like there was nowhere to go but up, yet history suggested otherwise. Many people thought it was only a matter of time until their tight grip strangled their chances. Others thought the computing paradigm would shift and leave us all behind. Then iPhone happened. It’s been more than a decade now—ancient history by technology standards. The new has become old, and that feeling of shift is in the air again. As technologists, we have to be asking ourselves: What does the future of these platforms look like? And what does that mean for us, and for our children? After years in this industry, traveling the world, meeting app makers and all sorts of interesting people, I have a few ideas, which may be worth indulging, if it helps us in the now, to build the next.","link":"/360-Conferences/2019/360-Conferences-2019-Mike-Lee-Foresight-is-2020/"},{"title":"Mike Scamell - Do the Loco-MotionLayout Building animations with MotionLayout","text":"You’ve heard, seen or witnessed the buzz around MotionLayout. But what does it look like in real life? What are some of its current limitations? How easy is it to use? Are the demos that we’ve seen actually possible? Or is it all a ruse? In this talk, we’ll use MotionLayout to develop an animation taken straight from a crazy designer’s mock-up. A mock-up that you see and crumble at how long it would typically take you to build it on Android. Throughout this talk, you’ll see some animated goodness and learn some of the fundamentals of how MotionLayout works. You’ll find out what a MotionScene is and how it separates your states and transitions from your layout, how to use click and swipe handling to trigger transitions, how to take advantage of KeyAttributes to tweak animations at certain frames, how to use CustomAttributes to animate certain parts of a View and more! You will leave this talk armed with the basic knowledge required to start having fun with MotionLayout and creating your own animations.

It’s filled with complex math and obscure system details, but that isn’t why it’s hard. Security is hard because it requires a different way of thinking. It’s about what systems really do rather than what they’re supposed to do. It’s about making things fail rather than succeed. It’s about controls and response more often than code and algorithms. And at its best it’s invisible and thankless. You never know all the bad things that didn’t happen. Security is critical. In our hyper-connected systems filled with sensitive information, we need developers who understand how to think about security and how to implement secure systems. Security requires expertise, but it can’t just be left to experts. It has to be a part of every stage of development. No one wants to be the next company listed under an embarrassing headline.

Regardless of what the language and design patterns we use when writing an app, there is only one way to ensure correctness and quality: testing, static analysis and continuous integration. Many still think that setting up a CI for your project is hard, onerous, and not that useful, but we’re going to see how this is not true. Focusing on static analysis and unit testing, we’ll walk through setting up a continuous integration pipeline for a modern open source Android project using Gradle, CircleCI and Kotlin. We’ll see what benefits this brings to a codebase and how with a few tricks we can make sure external contributors adhere to the project code style, how we can prevent subtle bugs to sneak into the codebase, all with very little effort and zero budget. https://twitter.com/seebrock3r https://appbuilders.ch","link":"/App-Builders/2019/App-Builders-2019-Computer-Says-No-Static-Analysis-and-CI-in-a-Kotlin-Word-Sebastiano-Poggi/"},{"title":"Embrace the WorkManager - Pietro Maggi - App Builders 2019","text":"After all of 2018 spent as alpha and beta, WorkManager graduated in 2019 to its first stable release and it is now the recommended solution for scheduling and executing deferrable background tasks in Android.

Even more amazing, a new type of composition appears that is difficult to see when dealing with only protocols.

That little sprinkle of Kotlin made all the difference, and life was great — we finally we had a way to make our least favorite calls more concise and easier to work with! Android KTX builds on this same idea and makes them available to everyone. It’s a new set of open source Kotlin extensions (maintained by Google) that sits on top of commonly used Framework methods, abstracting much of the complexity and boilerplate away. This vastly improves the conciseness and readability of your code, making it more idiomatic and enjoyable to work with. In this talk we’ll start with a brief intro to KTX — what it is, why it’s so great, and what it means for us as Android developers. Next we’ll take a tour of what extensions are currently available, highlighting some of my favorites. We’ll compare the old, hard ways of doing things against the new, friendlier ways that KTX provides so you can clearly see how life with KTX is better! By the end you’ll have a better idea of 1) how you can improve your Android code by using KTX in your daily work and 2) what well-designed extension methods look like so you can wrap/extend the Android framework for your own use (or to contribute back into KTX!)

A side story from that presentation that ended up generating many questions from the audience both after the talk, and since returning from the conference were our tools, Atlas and Peon. AtlasAtlas is a tool which we use at Hootsuite to visualize dependency graphs for our Kotlin/Java Android codebase, our ObjectiveC/Swift iOS codebase, and our Scala backend codebase. Originally written in Ruby, it has been rewritten in Kotlin/JS. Atlas scrapes Github for build files for Gradle, Carthage, and SBT. It then parses the build files and generates a dependency graph from them. The dependency graph can then be visualized as a PNG using graphviz or it can feed the graph to our Peon tool. Atlas is built to be extensible, each build system implements a generic worker interface. Atlas has been indispensable in development at Hootsuite, assisting in onboarding new developers, diagnosing bugs, and much more. I am very excited to finally Open Source the tool as a Kotlin/JS project and to dive deep into it for KotlinConf attendees so that they can use it in their own projects or even extend it to new build systems. PeonPeon was written because the Android team at Hootsuite was tired of bumping versions of libraries, both internal and external, and then cascading those changes up a dependency graph. Peon takes the dependency graph output of Atlas and then makes changes to the graph in an intelligent, and topologically aware, manner. Peon was also originally implemented in Ruby but is currently being rewritten in Kotlin/JS. Peon takes in a list of libraries to be updated in the graph. You can use it to update the version of Kotlin in all our projects or to bump a version of an external library. You can also use it to propagate changes to an internal library to the rest of the graph. Since deploying it at Hootsuite, Peon has saved hundred of developer hours. Peon will be released as an Open Source Kotlin/JS project prior to KotlinConf so that we can dive deep into this tool and attendees can integrate it with their own workflows. I am very excited to lead this talk, diving deep into both of these tools which are used daily at Hootsuite. I am especially interested in sharing the project with others so that they can save time on their own projects and teams. I am also interested in sharing my experience with Kotlin/JS, especially converting a Ruby project to Kotlin/JS. The benefits of the Kotlin type system for example, were immediately apparent, both within the project and when integrating with other Javascript libraries.

Object Oriented Programming (OOP)’s tendency of designing object-models for domain solutions in addition to its merits in handling large data and reducing complexity makes its usage a natural choice in the industry. Despite universal usage, Java’s limitations in language techniques fail to capture all domain design decisions in a cohesive manner. This issue describes aspects of relational domains, in which scattering and tangling between mapped sources and targets forces large-scale projects to sacrifice domains that guarantees quality software. Kotlin’s open-source community is active, its uses are ever-expanding, and its future is bright. This session intends to analyze a general definition of crosscutting and how it affects growing software, how Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) attempts to tackle crosscutting, shortcomings in Java’s current approaches in reflexive programming, and subsequently discuss my experiences with TornadoFX in solving day-to-day business inefficiencies through my first attempt at metaprogramming. Exploration through examples will provide insight in Kotlin’s approaches to metaprogramming intended to expose Kotln’s predisposition to AOP.

This talk covers UAST (Universal Abstract Syntax Tree), an API for working with languages generically. With UAST you can write a single tool that will work for both Java and Kotlin - no special casing needed. We talk about how to setup a plugin to use UAST and walk through a sample that works on mixed codebases. The talk also dives into the types of problems you can solve by writing an IntelliJ plugin, as well as other applications for UAST outside of IntelliJ IDEA.

But how should we exercise this freedom? How concise is too concise? (Surely not as concise as Perl.) How should we choose new language features, and how to mix our code with third party DSLs? When to omit optional features—and when to keep them in? Moreover, what is our ultimate goal? Is it brevity and ease of expression when writing code? Maintainability? Interoperability? Consistency? Or are we trying to write the next great Kotlin novel? This talk begins where the official Kotlin style guides end. Based on opinionated principles of great writing for the English language, from books like “On Writing Well” by William Zinsser, “On Writing” by Steven King, “What I Talk About When I Talk About Running” by Haruki Murakami, and more, this talk will explore what it means to write great code, by proposing what it means to write great Kotlin.

When a list of models can be compared, we can produce diffSet. These diffSet can be applied to the existing UI elements (UITableView and CollectionView) with little effort. The practical use case can be an efficient use of memory and UI reuse. However, the bigger side is every code that doesn’t interact with the UI can be written in a pure functional programming paradigm (without side effects, shared state). Extending a level beyond, simple equality is not merely enough for models with children which themselves are comparable. To overcome this nested equality and nested diffing we can use protocols and come up with a nested diffSet. This can be used for Sections/Rows. The talk will cover explaining the naive algorithm and the intent behind nested diffing on model layer.

The first layer is physiological needs (food, water, warmth, rest), the second one is safety needs (security, safety) and so on. But there is a new (modern) pyramid, where first two layers: battery life and access to wifi. Turned out the to run a machine learning model on the phone is more energy saver compared to send data outside (connection via internet required more energy, especially if you have a poor connection). The second piece here, when you send your data outside your mobile phone, that means, that you… send data outside :). Snowden tells something more about this. This is why running a ml model on your mobile phone sounds like a good idea. The next question is how to do it? Most machine learning algorithms (so far) has been implemented in Python or R, both look like a bit weird for mobile technology.

As with any system, it’s important to maintain good Unit &amp; Integration test coverage - and this is usually not too difficult. UI and System tests, however, can be non-trivial when taking into consideration the multitudes of available frameworks. In this situation, how much time do we spend evaluating each framework? How much time do we spend developing and integrating them into our CI flow, and how do we make sure we get value from doing so? In this talk, I will be showing how we have gone through this process for both the Android, and AndroidTV applications for NRKTV. I will mention which frameworks we use and why, where and when we run these tests, and what value this has given us. Hopefully, this can inspire others to invest time and energy to try and achieve a similar level of quality control in their applications.

We’re interested in trying to figure out the feasibility of doing a “write once, run everywhere” solution where we implement the logic once and then either transpile or run in an interpreter that library on each client. We looked into using JavaScript, Kotlin, C++, and Rust, each one has their advantages and disadvantages. In my talk, I will run through the advantages and disadvantages of each of these languages.

Especially when we take into mind that a big part of the world population can only access the Internet via their smartphone. This talk explores the theoretical background of animation, the limitations and opportunities animations brings when done in the mobile browser, the connection of animation to touch gestures and some practical code examples of how animation can be incorporated into mobile websites. This talk is backed by a lot of science, theory and experience, since I wrote my master thesis in this field, which was titled ‘Touch Interaction and Animation in Mobile Web Interfaces’. During the thesis I developed a mobile PWA that looked similar to native application (http://masterthesis.lisilinhart.info) and conducted a user study that A / B tested this prototype with and without animation. I feel that the insight I gained during the research can be transformed into an insightful talk, that’s especially compelling for developers who are interested in usability, animation and touch interaction in the mobile web browser. A common question that guided this research was how to make websites feel more like native applications.

SwiftUI, for instance, relies heavily on it to provide its system of data-binding through annotations like @State, @EnvironmentObjects, etc. Unlike other language improvements, Codable for instance, Apple hasn’t restricted the use of this new feature to its own frameworks: any codebase is free to leverage it to implement custom property attributes that will suit its own specific needs. While this is a great opportunity to factorise common behaviours throughout a project, one can still wonder: won’t it hurt code readability and predictability on the long run? Keeping code short is good, but if it’s achieved through a collection of arcane annotations, it might end up defying the original intent.

Autolayouts are here to solve complex relations between UI objects and make a robust UI that will hopefully require less maintenance with the introduction of new device form factors.MotivationAutolayouts first appeared in iOS 6 and XCode 4.6. They constituted a big change in interface design. A complex set of rules was introduced for UI implementation. Let’s be honest, this was not a good start since Interface Builder at the beginning was trying to be smarter than the developer and was modifying the designs in an often unwanted way.The programatically applied interfaces have been introduced as the alternative to IB, but the NSLayoutConstraint’s lengthy method constraintWithItem: scares many programmers and the ASCII­art from constraintsWithVisualFormat: gives a headache at the first glance.The issues with IB are pretty much in the past. It’s now way easier to create desired constraints and debug them in the XCode 5.0+. Open source programmers have not been lagging behind and we can now find libraries helping with the interface design in code.During my daily work I can see that the Autolayout is being more and more used in the interface design, but when it comes to dynamic changes in the interface (and animations in particular) many programmers revert to the “comfort zone” of pixels and frames. All that can obviously be done using autolayouts, easier than you might have thought.The TalkI’ll show how to create layouts that adjust to both iPhone and iPad design and respond adequately to the changing content.I’ll present how to interpret and fix warnings and errors that are presented in the Interface Builder. I’ll show when and how to create and manipulate autolayout constraints in code and create fun animations.I’ll introduce the Lyt library (https://github.com/robotmedia/Lyt).As an addition I’ll also introduce the NibWrapper library for modular interface design that plays very well with Autolayouts (https://github.com/mobilejazz/NibWrapper). +info: https://github.com/mobiosis/NSSpain-autolayout-test","link":"/NSSpain/2014/NSSpain-2014-NSSpain-2014-Autolayout-for-everyone-by-Krzysztof-Kucharewicz/"},{"title":"NSSpain 2014 \"Can't handle my scale\" by Michele Titolo","text":"Scaling an app means many things.

Coordinators are objects that control flow in an app. Coordinators are typically initialized with a navigation controller, although they can manage other types of view controllers as well. View controllers are totally transparent to coordinators; view controllers display data as directed by their coordinator and bubble up events as delegate methods, which the coordinators respond to. This makes reusing view controllers completely trivial, since the view controller doesn’t bring any baggage along with it. Much like views and view controllers, coordinators are found in a tree structure. The root coordinator is called the app coordinator, and contains the code for setting up the root view controller, which you might typically find in an app delegate. Swapping out app coordinators could change your app from an iPad layout to an iPhone layout. When a coordinator begins doing too many tasks, those tasks can be pushed down into a child coordinator. Complexity can easily be managed, and it has space for growth. The using the coordinator model is a simpler way of managing iOS apps and is a great tool for slimming down large view controllers.

Unfortunately, the Security framework is not well documented, isn’t specially developer friendly, and has not been thought to interact with 3rd parties, such as external servers making use of standard public key infrastructures and libraries such as OpenSSL. However, nowadays, it’s a common requisite for our apps to interact with secure backends and RESTful APIs making use of asymmetric cryptography, KPIs or public key systems. In this presentation, I will explain how to make your iOS application interact with these external public key infrastructures, importing keys from external entities (probably generated via OpenSSL) and exporting the keys generated at the device so they can be used in signature and verification operations externally. –Recorded and produced live by Stefan Völker.NSSpain 2017.","link":"/NSSpain/2017/NSSpain-2017-Asymmetric-Cryptography-Between-iOS-and-the-Rest-of-the-World-Ignacio-Nieto/"},{"title":"Building Buddybuild - Dennis Pilarinos","text":"Building iOS apps is difficult enough, without having to worry about building your build system as well.

With Apple’s push for Playgrounds.app and more permissive AppStore rules towards developer tools, it’s clear Apple wants us to write code on iOS. But is this all that’s needed to have world class IDEs for iOS? We’ll start with a walkthrough of the history and state of the art of iOS IDEs and related developer tools (developer-friendly text editors, git clients, terminal emulators, etc.). You’ll learn how Playgrounds.app works and what special rules it takes advantage of. We’ll go through the AppStore rules for developer tools, and what changed recently to allow more powerful IDEs. We’ll imagine how an IDE could look like on a multitouch device with new UIs and interactions, and what iOS 11 features we can leverage. A key feature of an IDE is executing code. We’ll learn how this is possible on iOS, its limitations, and the difference between interpreted, JITed and compiled execution. We’ll figure out what needs to change before we can have true desktop-grade IDEs on our iOS devices and put together an iOS 12 feature wishlist. –Recorded and produced live by Stefan Völker.NSSpain 2017.","link":"/NSSpain/2017/NSSpain-2017-Building-an-IDE-for-iOS-Mark-Villacampa/"},{"title":"Code snippets for Debugging - Carola Nitz","text":"Lightning Talk. –Recorded and produced live by Stefan Völker.NSSpain 2017.","link":"/NSSpain/2017/NSSpain-2017-Code-snippets-for-Debugging-Carola-Nitz/"},{"title":"Creating a Computer Vision Machine Learning App From The Ground Up - Jorge Molina & George Karavias","text":"Core ML, Apple’s new foundational machine learning framework, is blazingly fast not to mention dead easy to incorporate in an app. To top that off Core ML boasts support for a broad variety of machine learning model types and provides a Python package to convert them.

Many of them are brought in by developers coming from different programming background - like Java, Ruby, Javascript etc. There are lots of terms flying around like: MVVM, Flux, Redux, RX, VIPER etc. With existing terminology of MVC, Delegate and Singleton patterns and Dependency Injection — it’s not hard to imagine that even senior developers might find themselves overwhelmed. Many of the newer architectures are actively trying to replace existing coding practices that Apple continues to actively promote to developers and is implementing them in new APIs on the platform. In this talk I want to present an approach that doesn‘t replace anything - it embraces and builds on top of existing iOS API patterns. I will use an example (open-source) live app that shows: what’s the correct way to use MVC how to efficiently use DI (Dependency Injection) to properly transfer input data/configuration throughout the apphow and when to use Delegate pattern where and how to use Coordinators to manage data flow and display VCs, with minimum amount of boilerplate code where do components like network and API wrappers fit into the app how to create single point of data source for any other component in the app how to persist data in such a way that you can easily replace all of it with something else (say switch from Core Data to Realm) Each of the components is loosely coupled with the rest, each component does not care about the rest of the app. This separation of concern leads to easier testing, simpler maintainance and large degree of freedom to change data flow or even completely replace certain parts.

More talks on https://dotconferences.com/talks You write an app, you add a database to store the apps’s data. Seems simple enough. Over the years, though, the database scheme can quickly grow to become an untamed beast that makes you cry at night: adding extra columns that are really a cache of computed properties or extra tables to normalize some relationships needed in the UI. The database contains critical user data, yet can become the most hacked part of your code to correctly handle migrations and sync. The problem is your database is used both for storing critical data and for displaying that data and managing the UI. Your data model is torn between two antagonistic goals, and you have a kitchen sink database. Charles proposes a different approach where you explicitly separate those two functions, and which was successfully applied to architect two apps I worked on.","link":"/dotSwift/2019/dotSwift-2019-dotSwift-2019-Charles-Parnot-Avoiding-the-Kitchen-Sink-Database/"},{"title":"dotSwift 2019 - Daniel Jalkut - Just Enough Objective-C","text":"Filmed at https://2019.dotswift.io on January 28th in Paris.

Swift on the other hand lets you unlock best of both worlds: performance and safety. Naturally not all Swift code is magically fast and just like everything else in programming performance requires constant learning.

In this talk, we will explore how a ridesharing app works. We will ask questions such as: How do we find out where the passenger is located? How do we discover our destination? How do we find the closest driver? How do we provide a correct ETA to the passenger in heavy traffic? How do we display this information on a map? How do we find the best route to the destination? To answer these questions, we will be learning about a variety of location APIs, including Maps, Positioning, Geocoding, Routing, Traffic, Places, and much more.

Learning from the predecessors, designers of the language managed to accomplish this with only one reserved keyword: suspend. Coroutines were invented at the dawn of programming languages, but were quickly forgotten when threads and other fashionable techniques were popularized. They are making a major comeback as many mainstream languages have introduced support for coroutines and similar mechanisms: async/await, channels, goroutines. Kotlin language designers figured out a way to emulate many of those patterns by pushing the details to the library functions and reserving only one keyword: suspend.

But, sometimes, building the full experience from scratch in both Kotlin and Swift is not a good option. When we at Meetup were launching a new, mobile-first product and wanted a new mobile app — only the second native app in our fifteen-year history — we wanted to build a great product on both platforms, but we only had a few engineers and a couple of months to do so. React Native, with its promise to deliver truly native-quality experiences from a completely shared codebase, is one of the popular alternative ways to build a mobile app, but a lot of its documentation is targeted at web developers who want to make iOS apps. How should mobile engineers think about React Native? What dragons need particularly careful slaying on Android? In this talk, we’ll give a brief overview of how React Native works. We’ll share how we went from “git init” to a functioning app in two months, and talk about where we went from there. We’ll cover the things that still excite us about React Native, but be frank about its continued pitfalls. We’ll talk about how React Native fits into the broader space of cross-platform mobile solutions, and when you might want to choose something else.

Although it might seem that the mobile world is divided in two, that does not mean that iOS and Android apps can find ways to be speak “the same language”. It is crucial for Android developers to understand what happens on the iOS side, and vice versa. I believe that, part of the success for Android and iOS apps, resides in being able to find those similarities between the platforms, embrace them, and provide a common architecture between that two platform that facilitates the development… and who knows, maybe one day you can be writing for both platforms in Kotlin/Native ;) Let my explain in this talk why iOS is so important for Android developers, why Swift is so easy to understand when you know Kotlin, and how you can architect your apps in such a way that transitioning to Kotlin/Native will be a pice of cake!

To mitigate the risk of malicious apps, there is a need for an automated system to detect these applications. Current detection techniques rely on the signatures of well-documented malware, and hence may not be able to detect new malware samples. The majority of these approaches are based on either the analysis of complex features extracted from the files present in Android executables (e.g., DroidSafe) or dynamic features derived from an app’s behaviour during runtime. Extraction of such complex features is a tedious task and requires a considerable amount of time and system resources. With rapid increase in the amount and complexity of malware, it is beneficial to employ methods that do not rely on analysis of complex features and are time efficient. In this session, we will speak about an alternative solution. Instead of focusing on individual malware samples, we propose to turn our attention to malware developers. The benefit of this strategy is clear: generating a signature for malware developer rather than individual malware sample, we can effectively characterise all malware samples generated by a particular software developer. The primary premise for our work stems from authorship attribution field, typically used in literary domain. Author attribution domain assumes that each author possesses a unique writing style which can accurately identify his/her works among others. Our hypothesis is that a developer similar to an author has a unique programming style which is reflected through the various components of programs developed by him. By analysing such program components, we can possibly generate the author’s signature that can uniquely identify applications developed by that author. One of the simplest components that can represent an author’s writing style is a set of strings used by a developer throughout binary code. Various string components such as variables, class names, method names, and string literals reflect the writing preferences of the developer. We present an approach to identify an author of an given Android application using the author’s signature (profile) comprised of different string components that can potentially reflect the Android author’s style. Using these author signatures, we can effectively detect a wide range of existing, as well as any new, malware samples generated by particular authors.

But over time, new features came into play, network calls, asynchronous processing, your little baby turned out to be a monster and you loose yourself in the code, it’s not possible to tell in which state your app is between network calls, errors, user interactions, etc.. You’re lost ! Grox is an open source library (https://github.com/groupon/grox) that helps to manage the state of Kotlin / Java / Android applications. Inspired by Flux and Redux, Grox lets you express state changes in a testable and homogenous way. Grox offers a flexible, scalable way to manage the state of your application. With Grox you know in which exact state you are at any point in time, and you state will be represented clearly. Grox also offers time travel debugging, and a nice Rx API that plays very well with RxBinding and asynchronous code. In this session, we will explain why Grox is nice, give a few examples to use it, test your code and enjoy it’s scalability. You will see that Grox is a breeze to manage from the simplest app to the most complex ones.

HTTP/2 improvements like server push, file streaming, and TCP connection optimizations will change the way we use the Internet. Although the underlying networking libraries for Android will continue to handle the protocol changes automatically, it’s good for developers to understand the intricacies of HTTP/2 so they can take full advantage of the new feature set. In this talk, we’ll be going through the notable new features of HTTP/2, how app developers can adapt to ( and fully leverage) the changes, and what improvements can HTTP/2 bring to your mobile app. Content and programming organized by Ty Smith, GDE/GDG &amp; Mobile Tech Lead Manager at Uber &amp; Joaquim Verges, GDG &amp; Android Tech Lead at Twitch.

The CEO publishes a document that says “our clients must be fast as fuck” and the engineering team sets out on a quest to fix all performance bottlenecks. But how does an engineer validate that their improvements actually work? More importantly, how does the team prevent future performance regressions? Over a year ago, we at Slack asked these questions and decided to build a mobile performance testing pipeline that would continuously validate every code change for performance impact. In this talk, I will introduce the basic building blocks of this pipeline and share the lessons learned from building and maintaining this infrastructure.

Thanks to the maps and location technology in our smartphones, a whole generation has now grown up in a world where getting lost is truly a thing of the past. Location technology goes far beyond maps in the palm of our hand, however. Today it is at the heart of a broad range of applications, from logistics to games, from social networks to ridesharing. In this talk, we will explore how a ridesharing app works. We will ask questions such as: How do we find out where the passenger is located? How do we discover our destination? How do we find the closest driver? How do we provide a correct ETA to the passenger in heavy traffic? How do we display this information on a map? How do we find the best route to the destination? To answer these questions, we will be learning about a variety of location APIs, including Maps, Positioning, Geocoding, Routing, Traffic, Places, and much more. At the end you should be able to build your own ridesharing app or any clever app for which location matters.

Till 3 years ago, adding motion to your app was probably the last thing to be implemented IF it would be implemented at all. The main reasons were 2; A. it was a pain to animate the simplest thing and B. the feedback your users were expecting was an annoying dialog window for all the useful… and sometimes not so useful information. And that was fine! The last couple of years and after the introduction of the material design principles, this is not the case anymore. The users expect some meaningful feedback about their actions, that will not interfere though with the flow of their interaction and it will be “normal” to the eye.

But incredible customer experience is also incredibly difficult to pull off. Because it is the sum of a million minute decisions that come down to this one basic principle: Make life easier for the customer. Which really means: Remove all points of friction along every step of the way. Onboarding for most apps is the worst part of the whole app experience. Users hate doing it, developers hate writing it; but it’s important! Onboarding is the first impression any app has to delight and excite users to come on board.

Many of the apps have moved to Kotlin already, some have forgotten Java but some are still stuck in the Java land! Kotlin is here to stay and those who are stuck with Java do not mean to ignore Kotlin. It is just that they do not have the time and support to experiment yet another language because of deadlines. When they work with a Kotlin enthusiast or use a library developed in Kotlin, sometimes they hit roadblocks. Because of how Kotlin compiler helps with interoperability, Java developers get to consume the code in Kotlin but in an inefficient manner. This talk aims to provide some small tips and tricks to the Kotlin developers which will help them work well with Java developers and make their lives easier until their transition to Kotlin is complete.

As Android apps grow in complexity, so do their threading requirements. Any app that wants to go beyond simple user interactions and perform even basic functions like network or disk access, is multithreaded. We usually use provided abstractions to handle this for us, and rarely peek under the hood. In this talk we’ll take a look at some threading strategies such as, thread looper, round-robin scheduler, priority queue scheduler, and bounding of thread pools; strategies that are used in the Android platform itself, and by RxJava. It dives deep into the benefits and tradeoffs of different threading approaches, from both, a pure java and an Android perspective. At the end of the talk, you will understand how your apps are currently using threads, what the potential problems are and how you can go about manage your threads efficiently.

Faced with exactly this question for the Airbnb reservation system, we designed a server-driven UI framework for web, iOS, and Android that allows us to launch new types of reservations on all platforms with a simple backend change. It uses a commonly shared API that is parsed on the client and rendered into a set of corresponding components supported on all platforms. In this talk, I will discuss how we designed this multi-platform system to provide the flexibility needed to launch new types of reservations and UI components, while keeping boilerplate client code to a minimum. Using a common API across all platforms, this type of server-driven UI framework hits the sweet spot of customizability while minimizing redundant client-side work. Moreover, I’ll explain how this system has enabled us to deploy new features on all platforms simultaneously via a simple backend change, without having to release new versions of the native apps. In the code deep dive, I’ll go through the API that is used on all three platforms, how the polymorphic API response is parsed on Android, and how those data models are rendered into a reservation using Epoxy, Airbnb’s open-source library for rendering models in a RecyclerView. Finally, I’ll touch on some expanded use cases of this concept, such as multi-screen user flows for forms.

Unwanted or unexpected network traffic has a high cost as well. Users pay a lot of money for data and, in the worst case, with millions of users, your app can send enough traffic to your servers to cause serious problems. For this reason, we came to the conclusion that we need a systematic way of making mobile traffic safe. In this talk, I’ll discuss how we designed and built a tool for monitoring and managing all network traffic from inside the app. Using our monitoring tools, we’re able to detect and diagnose anomalous traffic. If necessary, with an external signal, we can safely shut off specific types of mobile traffic until the underlying issue can be fixed, protecting users’ batteries and data plans.

Abstract - Code reviews are essential for maintaining code quality and helping developers sharpen their coding skills. However, code reviews are also difficult to get right. Many code review comments end up being unclear, trivial, or condescending. With compassion as a guideline, though, we can work to establish code review practices that minimize suffering for everyone involved—the code authors, the code reviewers, the code maintainers, and even the end users. In this talk, you’ll learn that Compassionate Code Reviews are not about “sugarcoating” feedback and actually demand a considerable degree of candor. Equipped with a set of guidelines for executing Compassionate Code Reviews, you’ll leave inspired to apply them on your team to create better code and happier coders.

Swift NYC Conference 2018 - try! Swift is an immersive community gathering about Apple Technologies, Swift Language Best Practices, Application Development in Swift, Server-Side Swift, Open Source Swift, and the Swift Community in New York! Topic - SwiftNIO and Network.framework Speaker - Johannes Weiss Twitter - https://twitter.com/johannesweiss Bio - Johannes Weiss is a software engineer at Apple, working on the SwiftNIO project. Abstract - SwiftNIO was developed with a focus on providing useful, high-performance tools for building event-driven networking applications on the server side. It turns out that these primitives also work well in client applications. While the primitives transfer over, the networking environment is very different, and the socket layer, which works well in a server environment, is substantially less suited to operating on mobile clients. For this reason, SwiftNIO provides integration with the brand new Network.framework on Apple’s client devices: a modern network stack for a mobile age. This talk will discuss the powerful tools that Network.framework provides, and how SwiftNIO exposes them. It’ll discuss the different design tradeoffs between server and client side, and cover some of the key differences in the networking environments. Finally, this talk will look to the future, and discuss how the server and client worlds could converge over time. Presentation Link - Will be updated soon try!

Topic - All about linking librariesSpeaker - Kishikawa Katsumi Twitter - https://twitter.com/k_katsumi Bio - iOS Developer. Love to create small tools for developers. Abstract - When developing an iOS application, you rarely do not use libraries or framework.We use OS provided frameworks such like UIKit and Swift standard libraries. We also use useful third-party libraries.aAt the same time, everyone may have suffered from link errors, duplicate symbols, weird error messages from package managers.It is difficult to solve link errors because the cause of the problem comes from various things such as project setting, the library is static or dynamic, distribution method of the library or execution environment (on device or simulator). Learning the mechanism of the link makes you possible to solve the problems. In this talk, I will explain about a library and framework which can be used for iOS applications and explain the mechanism of how external libraries will be linked with your applications.

Swift is an immersive community gathering about Apple Technologies, Swift Language Best Practices, Application Development in Swift, Server-Side Swift, Open Source Swift, and the Swift Community in Tokyo! Topic - Generics in protocol extensionSpeaker - Hikaru Yoshimura Twitter - https://twitter.com/_yuu_ Bio - Hikaru Yoshimura works as a Scala engineer. He used to study type systems when he was in the university so he can program using some functional languages a little bit. He sometimes brings the good parts of languages like Scala, Haskell or OCaml to Swift. Abstract - The protocol only handle existensial type like associateType. For some protocol, when we give some functions in protocol extension, we must put a concreate type. Protocol extension will work like searching function based on type, so it’s needed concreate type in somewhere. For example, for some type called A, sometimes we want to write extension using List[A] finaly. In this talk, I’d like to consider how to create generics by force from existensial type like associatedType by using Curry-Howard correspondence.

Topic - Graphics like Pixar using SwiftSpeaker - Michael Petrie Twitter - https://twitter.com/kapsy1312 Bio - My name is Michael Petrie, but everyone calls me Kapsy. I work for ZOZO Technologies and lead the iOS measurement framework team. I have a background in games and real time programming, using C and C++, and yearn for the day when we can all decide on a common ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) and be happy. Abstract - This is a talk about some of the hurdles faced when writing a simple Ray Tracer from scratch, using Swift.Ray Tracing is the cornerstone of Pixar’s infamous Renderman 3D rendering technology, which dominates the animated film industry. It works by physically modeling light rays and their interactions with objects and surfaces. Within recent years there has been a renewed interest in real time Ray Tracing, with the advent of more powerful and specialized hardware such as NVIDIAs RTX. Even renowned programmer John Carmack has stated that “”all roads lead to Rome””, when asked about the future of real time computer graphics and Ray Tracing. While I enjoy working with traditional graphics rasterizers, I have always been interested in physically modeling light, and have wanted to learn more about the processes involved. Here I talk about how I programmed a Ray Tracer that renders a simple scene from first principles. Given the timing, it also seemed like the perfect opportunity to test the versatility of Swift.

Topic - Introduction to Swift KeypathsSpeaker - Benedikt Terhechte Twitter - https://twitter.com/terhechte Bio - Benedikt works as a Senior iOS Developer at the professional network XING. In previous jobs he developed solutions for customers such as Disney or Daimler-Chrysler. As an Indie Mac developer, he launched successful apps such as PhotoDesk and Hirundo. Benedikt started investigating Swift right after the 2014 release and writes about it on his popular blog. He also initiated the Core Value and SourceKittenDaemon open source projects Abstract - Keypaths were added in Swift 4. They’re a fantastic feature but sometimes it feels difficult to find good situations for using them. However, when understood and used the right way, keypaths allow you to implement additional abstractions into your codebase that would be much harder with generics or protocols. In order to be able to do that, though, it is useful to intuitively understand when to apply the Keypath pattern. This talk will first explain the different types of keypaths that exist and then go through real world examples to showcase how they can be leveraged in your own projects.

Having previously made iOS keyboards funky at SwiftKey, and contemporary art available at your fingertips with Artsy, she now prototypes exclusively to create the best experiences for VFX studios. She also makes technology accessible for entrepreneurs and startups through technical coaching at MENNENIA and Beluga Bean. Abstract - Why do we really write code? I’ve been wondering: how long is code suppose to live, and just how disposable is it? If our end goal is to deliver great and useful features for our users, is it worth writing disposable code to get to robust code? As good programmers we hone our craft, but let’s look at how can we put all that knowledge to good use so we build the right things, rather than just building things right. try!

Topic - Using C, C++ and Objective C frameworks in Swift appsSpeaker - Cecilia Humlelu Twitter - https://twitter.com/CeciliaHumlelu Bio - I am Cecilia, developer, miniature crafter, acroyogis, and maybe something more. One thing that you might have not guessed about me: I was once a lift truck operator. Abstract - Swift is powerful, it is also relatively new. There are a lot of open source libraries that are written in C, C++ or Objective C. Is there a way to use them all to triple the opportunities to create more unique apps? Yes, we can! In this talk we will go through the basics to explain the relationship among C, C++ and Objective C and demonstrate how to set up the dependencies in a swift project.
