Accuracy can vary wildly, and users complain loudly if your app destroys their battery. Even worse, location services APIs often feel like black boxes, leaving even experienced developers scratching their heads how to debug them. So how does it all actually work? How can your phone, solely using the position of a few satellites, figure out where you are to within a few meters? How, dare we ask, is the location technology sitting in our pockets indebted not only to the Cold War but to the navigational needs of 18th century sailors?

Completely native performance through the use of a JavaScript bridge natively available on all three mobile platforms. Cross-platform libraries for common use cases. Need to call a JSON API? Run http.getJSON() Style native apps using CSS. Yep, that’s actually a thing.Curious about how it all works? Come learn!

A coroutine is a light-weight thread that can be suspended and resumed later. Very precise definition, but might be confusing at first. What ‘light-weight thread’ means? How does suspension work? This talk uncovers the magic. We’ll discuss the concept of coroutines, the power of async/await, and how you can benefit from defining your asynchronous computations using suspend functions.","link":"/Mobile-Era/2017/Mobile-Era-2017-Svetlana-Isakova-Kotlin-Coroutines-Mobile-Era-2017/"},{"title":"Thomas Pettersen - Yr - The next generation weather visualization (Mobile Era 2017)","text":"Yr is the world’s 5th largest weather service.

Autolayouts are here to solve complex relations between UI objects and make a robust UI that will hopefully require less maintenance with the introduction of new device form factors.MotivationAutolayouts first appeared in iOS 6 and XCode 4.6. They constituted a big change in interface design. A complex set of rules was introduced for UI implementation. Let’s be honest, this was not a good start since Interface Builder at the beginning was trying to be smarter than the developer and was modifying the designs in an often unwanted way.The programatically applied interfaces have been introduced as the alternative to IB, but the NSLayoutConstraint’s lengthy method constraintWithItem: scares many programmers and the ASCII­art from constraintsWithVisualFormat: gives a headache at the first glance.The issues with IB are pretty much in the past. It’s now way easier to create desired constraints and debug them in the XCode 5.0+. Open source programmers have not been lagging behind and we can now find libraries helping with the interface design in code.During my daily work I can see that the Autolayout is being more and more used in the interface design, but when it comes to dynamic changes in the interface (and animations in particular) many programmers revert to the “comfort zone” of pixels and frames. All that can obviously be done using autolayouts, easier than you might have thought.The TalkI’ll show how to create layouts that adjust to both iPhone and iPad design and respond adequately to the changing content.I’ll present how to interpret and fix warnings and errors that are presented in the Interface Builder. I’ll show when and how to create and manipulate autolayout constraints in code and create fun animations.I’ll introduce the Lyt library (https://github.com/robotmedia/Lyt).As an addition I’ll also introduce the NibWrapper library for modular interface design that plays very well with Autolayouts (https://github.com/mobilejazz/NibWrapper). +info: https://github.com/mobiosis/NSSpain-autolayout-test","link":"/NSSpain/2014/NSSpain-2014-NSSpain-2014-Autolayout-for-everyone-by-Krzysztof-Kucharewicz/"},{"title":"NSSpain 2014 \"Swift and C\" by Mike Ash","text":"Swift provides rich facilities for OO and functional programming, but it also allows extensive bridging to C APIs.

Coordinators are objects that control flow in an app. Coordinators are typically initialized with a navigation controller, although they can manage other types of view controllers as well. View controllers are totally transparent to coordinators; view controllers display data as directed by their coordinator and bubble up events as delegate methods, which the coordinators respond to. This makes reusing view controllers completely trivial, since the view controller doesn’t bring any baggage along with it. Much like views and view controllers, coordinators are found in a tree structure. The root coordinator is called the app coordinator, and contains the code for setting up the root view controller, which you might typically find in an app delegate. Swapping out app coordinators could change your app from an iPad layout to an iPhone layout. When a coordinator begins doing too many tasks, those tasks can be pushed down into a child coordinator. Complexity can easily be managed, and it has space for growth. The using the coordinator model is a simpler way of managing iOS apps and is a great tool for slimming down large view controllers.

Unfortunately, the Security framework is not well documented, isn’t specially developer friendly, and has not been thought to interact with 3rd parties, such as external servers making use of standard public key infrastructures and libraries such as OpenSSL. However, nowadays, it’s a common requisite for our apps to interact with secure backends and RESTful APIs making use of asymmetric cryptography, KPIs or public key systems. In this presentation, I will explain how to make your iOS application interact with these external public key infrastructures, importing keys from external entities (probably generated via OpenSSL) and exporting the keys generated at the device so they can be used in signature and verification operations externally. –Recorded and produced live by Stefan Völker.NSSpain 2017.","link":"/NSSpain/2017/NSSpain-2017-Asymmetric-Cryptography-Between-iOS-and-the-Rest-of-the-World-Ignacio-Nieto/"},{"title":"Building Buddybuild - Dennis Pilarinos","text":"Building iOS apps is difficult enough, without having to worry about building your build system as well.

I will use an example (open-source) live app that shows: what’s the correct way to use MVC how to efficiently use DI (Dependency Injection) to properly transfer input data/configuration throughout the apphow and when to use Delegate pattern where and how to use Coordinators to manage data flow and display VCs, with minimum amount of boilerplate code where do components like network and API wrappers fit into the app how to create single point of data source for any other component in the app how to persist data in such a way that you can easily replace all of it with something else (say switch from Core Data to Realm) Each of the components is loosely coupled with the rest, each component does not care about the rest of the app. This separation of concern leads to easier testing, simpler maintainance and large degree of freedom to change data flow or even completely replace certain parts. If the architecture must have a name, MVC-C-DNA would suffice. :) –Recorded and produced live by Stefan Völker.NSSpain 2017.","link":"/NSSpain/2017/NSSpain-2017-Highly-maintainable-App-Architecture-Aleksandar-Vacic/"},{"title":"How I Spent All My Savings Reinventing Programming - Luis Solano","text":"I’m sure you’ve had the same question too: what is “The Best Way™” of programming?

Topic - Compassionate—Yet Candid—Code Reviews Speaker - April Wensel Twitter - https://twitter.com/aprilwensel Bio - April Wensel is an international speaker and the founder of Compassionate Coding, a conscious business that helps technical teams cultivate sustainable, human-­centered software development practices built on a foundation of emotional intelligence. She has spent the past decade as a software engineer and technical leader at various startups in Silicon Valley, building products in such fields as healthcare, education, gaming, and user research. As an advocate for a more socially responsible tech industry, she also mentors technologists around the world and volunteers with organizations to teach coding to people from underrepresented groups. When not coding or speaking, she enjoys writing, running ultramarathons, and experimenting with vegan recipes. Abstract - Code reviews are essential for maintaining code quality and helping developers sharpen their coding skills. However, code reviews are also difficult to get right. Many code review comments end up being unclear, trivial, or condescending. With compassion as a guideline, though, we can work to establish code review practices that minimize suffering for everyone involved—the code authors, the code reviewers, the code maintainers, and even the end users. In this talk, you’ll learn that Compassionate Code Reviews are not about “sugarcoating” feedback and actually demand a considerable degree of candor. Equipped with a set of guidelines for executing Compassionate Code Reviews, you’ll leave inspired to apply them on your team to create better code and happier coders.

Think again: Apple’s Create ML gets you started in the comfort of Xcode and Swift! No math needed :]. Create ML is brilliant for getting you started with ML. It makes it easy to try different datasets — getting your data right is actually the hardest and most time consuming part of ML. Once you get started with ML, you won’t want to wait / hope for Apple to add more models to Create ML. To help you explore the ML universe that’s written in Python, I’ll reduce the fright factor by comparing Create ML Swift with Turi Create Python, and showing you how to quick-start your exploration of Turi Create.

She blogs at GrokSwift.com and wrote an ebook on creating iOS apps with REST APIs. She tried living and travelling on a sailboat for a few years but the internet connection just wasn’t good enough. Abstract - Siri Shortcuts help to improve your user experience by making actions available with Siri in iOS, watchOS, CarPlay and HomePod. We can set up our apps to give easy access to frequent actions without needing to open the app. Even better, iOS can suggest frequently used actions pro-actively using notifications or the lock screen. We’ll see how to add custom Siri Shortcuts to our apps, how to expose them so that Siri can recommend them, and how to let users set up their own voice commands to access their favourite Shortcuts.

Swift NYC Conference 2018 - try! Swift is an immersive community gathering about Apple Technologies, Swift Language Best Practices, Application Development in Swift, Server-Side Swift, Open Source Swift, and the Swift Community in New York! Topic - SwiftNIO and Network.framework Speaker - Johannes Weiss Twitter - https://twitter.com/johannesweiss Bio - Johannes Weiss is a software engineer at Apple, working on the SwiftNIO project. Abstract - SwiftNIO was developed with a focus on providing useful, high-performance tools for building event-driven networking applications on the server side. It turns out that these primitives also work well in client applications. While the primitives transfer over, the networking environment is very different, and the socket layer, which works well in a server environment, is substantially less suited to operating on mobile clients. For this reason, SwiftNIO provides integration with the brand new Network.framework on Apple’s client devices: a modern network stack for a mobile age. This talk will discuss the powerful tools that Network.framework provides, and how SwiftNIO exposes them. It’ll discuss the different design tradeoffs between server and client side, and cover some of the key differences in the networking environments. Finally, this talk will look to the future, and discuss how the server and client worlds could converge over time. Presentation Link - Will be updated soon try!

Abstract - When developing an iOS application, you rarely do not use libraries or framework.We use OS provided frameworks such like UIKit and Swift standard libraries. We also use useful third-party libraries.aAt the same time, everyone may have suffered from link errors, duplicate symbols, weird error messages from package managers.It is difficult to solve link errors because the cause of the problem comes from various things such as project setting, the library is static or dynamic, distribution method of the library or execution environment (on device or simulator). Learning the mechanism of the link makes you possible to solve the problems.

Topic - Generics in protocol extensionSpeaker - Hikaru Yoshimura Twitter - https://twitter.com/_yuu_ Bio - Hikaru Yoshimura works as a Scala engineer. He used to study type systems when he was in the university so he can program using some functional languages a little bit. He sometimes brings the good parts of languages like Scala, Haskell or OCaml to Swift. Abstract - The protocol only handle existensial type like associateType. For some protocol, when we give some functions in protocol extension, we must put a concreate type. Protocol extension will work like searching function based on type, so it’s needed concreate type in somewhere. For example, for some type called A, sometimes we want to write extension using List[A] finaly. In this talk, I’d like to consider how to create generics by force from existensial type like associatedType by using Curry-Howard correspondence.

I have a background in games and real time programming, using C and C++, and yearn for the day when we can all decide on a common ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) and be happy. Abstract - This is a talk about some of the hurdles faced when writing a simple Ray Tracer from scratch, using Swift.Ray Tracing is the cornerstone of Pixar’s infamous Renderman 3D rendering technology, which dominates the animated film industry. It works by physically modeling light rays and their interactions with objects and surfaces. Within recent years there has been a renewed interest in real time Ray Tracing, with the advent of more powerful and specialized hardware such as NVIDIAs RTX. Even renowned programmer John Carmack has stated that “”all roads lead to Rome””, when asked about the future of real time computer graphics and Ray Tracing. While I enjoy working with traditional graphics rasterizers, I have always been interested in physically modeling light, and have wanted to learn more about the processes involved. Here I talk about how I programmed a Ray Tracer that renders a simple scene from first principles. Given the timing, it also seemed like the perfect opportunity to test the versatility of Swift.

He also initiated the Core Value and SourceKittenDaemon open source projects Abstract - Keypaths were added in Swift 4. They’re a fantastic feature but sometimes it feels difficult to find good situations for using them. However, when understood and used the right way, keypaths allow you to implement additional abstractions into your codebase that would be much harder with generics or protocols. In order to be able to do that, though, it is useful to intuitively understand when to apply the Keypath pattern. This talk will first explain the different types of keypaths that exist and then go through real world examples to showcase how they can be leveraged in your own projects.

Topic - Swift type metadataSpeaker - Yuta Saito Twitter - https://twitter.com/kateinoigakukun Bio - Yuta is an intern at Mercari’s iOS team. He gets lost with Swift everyday in the beautiful world of types. His hobby recently is to read the Swift compiler. Abstract - Swift has type metadata, which can be stored type infomation on runtime. We don’t use directly not so much, but it’s important to understand the behavior of Swift runtime. In this talk, I’d like to talk about the type metadata and its implementation.

Topic - Using C, C++ and Objective C frameworks in Swift appsSpeaker - Cecilia Humlelu Twitter - https://twitter.com/CeciliaHumlelu Bio - I am Cecilia, developer, miniature crafter, acroyogis, and maybe something more. One thing that you might have not guessed about me: I was once a lift truck operator. Abstract - Swift is powerful, it is also relatively new. There are a lot of open source libraries that are written in C, C++ or Objective C. Is there a way to use them all to triple the opportunities to create more unique apps? Yes, we can! In this talk we will go through the basics to explain the relationship among C, C++ and Objective C and demonstrate how to set up the dependencies in a swift project.

Having previously made iOS keyboards funky at SwiftKey, and contemporary art available at your fingertips with Artsy, she now prototypes exclusively to create the best experiences for VFX studios. She also makes technology accessible for entrepreneurs and startups through technical coaching at MENNENIA and Beluga Bean. Abstract - Why do we really write code? I’ve been wondering: how long is code suppose to live, and just how disposable is it? If our end goal is to deliver great and useful features for our users, is it worth writing disposable code to get to robust code? As good programmers we hone our craft, but let’s look at how can we put all that knowledge to good use so we build the right things, rather than just building things right. try!

Swift Tokyo Conference 2019 - try! Swift is an immersive community gathering about Apple Technologies, Swift Language Best Practices, Application Development in Swift, Server-Side Swift, Open Source Swift, and the Swift Community in Tokyo! Topic - The Laws of MagicSpeaker - Dave DeLong Twitter - https://twitter.com/davedelong Bio - A seven-year veteran of Apple, Dave DeLong is an accomplished iOS engineer with a passion for teaching, experimentation, and hacking the Objective-C runtime. During his time at Apple, he worked on the UIKit framework, Developer Evangelism, and Apple Maps. He also worked on the Product Experience team at Snap, Inc. Dave, his family, and his large collection of Brandon Sanderson books live near Salt Lake City, where he’s an active member of the local developer community. He can often be found on Twitter teaching developers about all the ways that calendrical calculations can go wrong and pontificating on the virtues of eating chocolate with peanut butter. Abstract - Learn to develop intelligent and immersive experiences by following rules inspired by Sci-Fi and Fantasy fiction. Like software, a complex and engaging magic system uses guidelines to construct a concrete user experience. This talk explores some speculative laws that support fictional world-building and shows how you can incorporate these lessons into your day-to-day app and code development to produce the same result: user engagement, purpose, and a sense of wonder.
