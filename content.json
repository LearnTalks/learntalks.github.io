That little sprinkle of Kotlin made all the difference, and life was great — we finally we had a way to make our least favorite calls more concise and easier to work with! Android KTX builds on this same idea and makes them available to everyone. It’s a new set of open source Kotlin extensions (maintained by Google) that sits on top of commonly used Framework methods, abstracting much of the complexity and boilerplate away. This vastly improves the conciseness and readability of your code, making it more idiomatic and enjoyable to work with. In this talk we’ll start with a brief intro to KTX — what it is, why it’s so great, and what it means for us as Android developers. Next we’ll take a tour of what extensions are currently available, highlighting some of my favorites. We’ll compare the old, hard ways of doing things against the new, friendlier ways that KTX provides so you can clearly see how life with KTX is better! By the end you’ll have a better idea of 1) how you can improve your Android code by using KTX in your daily work and 2) what well-designed extension methods look like so you can wrap/extend the Android framework for your own use (or to contribute back into KTX!)

A side story from that presentation that ended up generating many questions from the audience both after the talk, and since returning from the conference were our tools, Atlas and Peon. AtlasAtlas is a tool which we use at Hootsuite to visualize dependency graphs for our Kotlin/Java Android codebase, our ObjectiveC/Swift iOS codebase, and our Scala backend codebase. Originally written in Ruby, it has been rewritten in Kotlin/JS. Atlas scrapes Github for build files for Gradle, Carthage, and SBT. It then parses the build files and generates a dependency graph from them. The dependency graph can then be visualized as a PNG using graphviz or it can feed the graph to our Peon tool. Atlas is built to be extensible, each build system implements a generic worker interface. Atlas has been indispensable in development at Hootsuite, assisting in onboarding new developers, diagnosing bugs, and much more. I am very excited to finally Open Source the tool as a Kotlin/JS project and to dive deep into it for KotlinConf attendees so that they can use it in their own projects or even extend it to new build systems. PeonPeon was written because the Android team at Hootsuite was tired of bumping versions of libraries, both internal and external, and then cascading those changes up a dependency graph. Peon takes the dependency graph output of Atlas and then makes changes to the graph in an intelligent, and topologically aware, manner. Peon was also originally implemented in Ruby but is currently being rewritten in Kotlin/JS. Peon takes in a list of libraries to be updated in the graph. You can use it to update the version of Kotlin in all our projects or to bump a version of an external library. You can also use it to propagate changes to an internal library to the rest of the graph. Since deploying it at Hootsuite, Peon has saved hundred of developer hours. Peon will be released as an Open Source Kotlin/JS project prior to KotlinConf so that we can dive deep into this tool and attendees can integrate it with their own workflows. I am very excited to lead this talk, diving deep into both of these tools which are used daily at Hootsuite. I am especially interested in sharing the project with others so that they can save time on their own projects and teams. I am also interested in sharing my experience with Kotlin/JS, especially converting a Ruby project to Kotlin/JS. The benefits of the Kotlin type system for example, were immediately apparent, both within the project and when integrating with other Javascript libraries.

Raft is a consensus protocol that is used in many production systems like Docker swarm, Consul, Kudu, RavenDB etc. This protocol is based on asynchronous communication between nodes in a cluster (with leader election, log replication, tolerate node failures, timeouts etc.), so we need some useful mechanisms and language features to effectively implement protocol behavior. During the talk, we briefly discuss Raft basics and then, in a code, look how part of the protocol could be implemented using coroutines and Ktor Framework. In the end, we will see in-memory key-value store based on Raft protocol that can tolerate node failures in the work. About the Presenter:Andrii Rodionov is a JUG UA leader and JavaDay UA conference organizer.

Object Oriented Programming (OOP)’s tendency of designing object-models for domain solutions in addition to its merits in handling large data and reducing complexity makes its usage a natural choice in the industry. Despite universal usage, Java’s limitations in language techniques fail to capture all domain design decisions in a cohesive manner. This issue describes aspects of relational domains, in which scattering and tangling between mapped sources and targets forces large-scale projects to sacrifice domains that guarantees quality software. Kotlin’s open-source community is active, its uses are ever-expanding, and its future is bright. This session intends to analyze a general definition of crosscutting and how it affects growing software, how Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) attempts to tackle crosscutting, shortcomings in Java’s current approaches in reflexive programming, and subsequently discuss my experiences with TornadoFX in solving day-to-day business inefficiencies through my first attempt at metaprogramming. Exploration through examples will provide insight in Kotlin’s approaches to metaprogramming intended to expose Kotln’s predisposition to AOP. By harnessing the power of Kotlin, we can make strides in creating a foundation for rational framework for metaprogramming.

These features could not be built using similar, but more limited, mechanisms, such as annotation processing. The Kotlin compiler plugin API is not currently well-documented, but that doesn’t mean that it can’t be explored! In this talk, we start from scratch and show how we can build a compiler plugin and deploy an artifact to a public location, so that we can build plugins that can be applied as easily as the official compiler plugins.

Autolayouts are here to solve complex relations between UI objects and make a robust UI that will hopefully require less maintenance with the introduction of new device form factors.MotivationAutolayouts first appeared in iOS 6 and XCode 4.6. They constituted a big change in interface design. A complex set of rules was introduced for UI implementation. Let’s be honest, this was not a good start since Interface Builder at the beginning was trying to be smarter than the developer and was modifying the designs in an often unwanted way.The programatically applied interfaces have been introduced as the alternative to IB, but the NSLayoutConstraint’s lengthy method constraintWithItem: scares many programmers and the ASCII­art from constraintsWithVisualFormat: gives a headache at the first glance.The issues with IB are pretty much in the past. It’s now way easier to create desired constraints and debug them in the XCode 5.0+. Open source programmers have not been lagging behind and we can now find libraries helping with the interface design in code.During my daily work I can see that the Autolayout is being more and more used in the interface design, but when it comes to dynamic changes in the interface (and animations in particular) many programmers revert to the “comfort zone” of pixels and frames. All that can obviously be done using autolayouts, easier than you might have thought.The TalkI’ll show how to create layouts that adjust to both iPhone and iPad design and respond adequately to the changing content.I’ll present how to interpret and fix warnings and errors that are presented in the Interface Builder. I’ll show when and how to create and manipulate autolayout constraints in code and create fun animations.I’ll introduce the Lyt library (https://github.com/robotmedia/Lyt).As an addition I’ll also introduce the NibWrapper library for modular interface design that plays very well with Autolayouts (https://github.com/mobilejazz/NibWrapper). +info: https://github.com/mobiosis/NSSpain-autolayout-test","link":"/NSSpain/2014/NSSpain-2014-NSSpain-2014-Autolayout-for-everyone-by-Krzysztof-Kucharewicz/"},{"title":"NSSpain 2014 Interview with Ash Furrow","text":"NSSpain Interview: Ash Furrow talks about Swift and his upcoming book.","link":"/NSSpain/2014/NSSpain-2014-NSSpain-2014-Interview-with-Ash-Furrow/"},{"title":"NSSpain 2014 Interview with Enric Enrich and Jaime Paulo","text":"NSSpain Interview: Enric Enrich and Jaime Paulo","link":"/NSSpain/2014/NSSpain-2014-NSSpain-2014-Interview-with-Enric-Enrich-and-Jaime-Paulo/"},{"title":"NSSpain 2014 Interview with Orta Therox","text":"Stefan Völker talks with Orta Therox about his “A Swift Start”","link":"/NSSpain/2014/NSSpain-2014-NSSpain-2014-Interview-with-Orta-Therox/"},{"title":"NSSpain 2014 \"Swift and C\" by Mike Ash","text":"Swift provides rich facilities for OO and functional programming, but it also allows extensive bridging to C APIs.

Coordinators are objects that control flow in an app. Coordinators are typically initialized with a navigation controller, although they can manage other types of view controllers as well. View controllers are totally transparent to coordinators; view controllers display data as directed by their coordinator and bubble up events as delegate methods, which the coordinators respond to. This makes reusing view controllers completely trivial, since the view controller doesn’t bring any baggage along with it. Much like views and view controllers, coordinators are found in a tree structure. The root coordinator is called the app coordinator, and contains the code for setting up the root view controller, which you might typically find in an app delegate. Swapping out app coordinators could change your app from an iPad layout to an iPhone layout. When a coordinator begins doing too many tasks, those tasks can be pushed down into a child coordinator. Complexity can easily be managed, and it has space for growth. The using the coordinator model is a simpler way of managing iOS apps and is a great tool for slimming down large view controllers.

However, nowadays, it’s a common requisite for our apps to interact with secure backends and RESTful APIs making use of asymmetric cryptography, KPIs or public key systems. In this presentation, I will explain how to make your iOS application interact with these external public key infrastructures, importing keys from external entities (probably generated via OpenSSL) and exporting the keys generated at the device so they can be used in signature and verification operations externally. –Recorded and produced live by Stefan Völker.NSSpain 2017.","link":"/NSSpain/2017/NSSpain-2017-Asymmetric-Cryptography-Between-iOS-and-the-Rest-of-the-World-Ignacio-Nieto/"},{"title":"Building Buddybuild - Dennis Pilarinos","text":"Building iOS apps is difficult enough, without having to worry about building your build system as well.

Many of them are brought in by developers coming from different programming background - like Java, Ruby, Javascript etc. There are lots of terms flying around like: MVVM, Flux, Redux, RX, VIPER etc. With existing terminology of MVC, Delegate and Singleton patterns and Dependency Injection — it’s not hard to imagine that even senior developers might find themselves overwhelmed. Many of the newer architectures are actively trying to replace existing coding practices that Apple continues to actively promote to developers and is implementing them in new APIs on the platform. In this talk I want to present an approach that doesn‘t replace anything - it embraces and builds on top of existing iOS API patterns. I will use an example (open-source) live app that shows: what’s the correct way to use MVC how to efficiently use DI (Dependency Injection) to properly transfer input data/configuration throughout the apphow and when to use Delegate pattern where and how to use Coordinators to manage data flow and display VCs, with minimum amount of boilerplate code where do components like network and API wrappers fit into the app how to create single point of data source for any other component in the app how to persist data in such a way that you can easily replace all of it with something else (say switch from Core Data to Realm) Each of the components is loosely coupled with the rest, each component does not care about the rest of the app. This separation of concern leads to easier testing, simpler maintainance and large degree of freedom to change data flow or even completely replace certain parts. If the architecture must have a name, MVC-C-DNA would suffice. :) –Recorded and produced live by Stefan Völker.NSSpain 2017.","link":"/NSSpain/2017/NSSpain-2017-Highly-maintainable-App-Architecture-Aleksandar-Vacic/"},{"title":"How I Spent All My Savings Reinventing Programming - Luis Solano","text":"I’m sure you’ve had the same question too: what is “The Best Way™” of programming?

How do we find the closest driver? How do we provide a correct ETA to the passenger in heavy traffic? How do we display this information on a map? How do we find the best route to the destination? To answer these questions, we will be learning about a variety of location APIs, including Maps, Positioning, Geocoding, Routing, Traffic, Places, and much more.

We’ll also look at some tricks that D8 and R8 can do which their predecessors could not. Finally, we’ll cover how to enable both tools in your build and recommendations to ensure you’re getting the most out of each.

But, sometimes, building the full experience from scratch in both Kotlin and Swift is not a good option. When we at Meetup were launching a new, mobile-first product and wanted a new mobile app — only the second native app in our fifteen-year history — we wanted to build a great product on both platforms, but we only had a few engineers and a couple of months to do so. React Native, with its promise to deliver truly native-quality experiences from a completely shared codebase, is one of the popular alternative ways to build a mobile app, but a lot of its documentation is targeted at web developers who want to make iOS apps. How should mobile engineers think about React Native? What dragons need particularly careful slaying on Android? In this talk, we’ll give a brief overview of how React Native works. We’ll share how we went from “git init” to a functioning app in two months, and talk about where we went from there. We’ll cover the things that still excite us about React Native, but be frank about its continued pitfalls. We’ll talk about how React Native fits into the broader space of cross-platform mobile solutions, and when you might want to choose something else. And we’ll be sure, throughout it all, not to treat Android as the second-most-important mobile platform.

To mitigate the risk of malicious apps, there is a need for an automated system to detect these applications. Current detection techniques rely on the signatures of well-documented malware, and hence may not be able to detect new malware samples. The majority of these approaches are based on either the analysis of complex features extracted from the files present in Android executables (e.g., DroidSafe) or dynamic features derived from an app’s behaviour during runtime. Extraction of such complex features is a tedious task and requires a considerable amount of time and system resources. With rapid increase in the amount and complexity of malware, it is beneficial to employ methods that do not rely on analysis of complex features and are time efficient. In this session, we will speak about an alternative solution. Instead of focusing on individual malware samples, we propose to turn our attention to malware developers. The benefit of this strategy is clear: generating a signature for malware developer rather than individual malware sample, we can effectively characterise all malware samples generated by a particular software developer. The primary premise for our work stems from authorship attribution field, typically used in literary domain. Author attribution domain assumes that each author possesses a unique writing style which can accurately identify his/her works among others. Our hypothesis is that a developer similar to an author has a unique programming style which is reflected through the various components of programs developed by him. By analysing such program components, we can possibly generate the author’s signature that can uniquely identify applications developed by that author. One of the simplest components that can represent an author’s writing style is a set of strings used by a developer throughout binary code. Various string components such as variables, class names, method names, and string literals reflect the writing preferences of the developer. We present an approach to identify an author of an given Android application using the author’s signature (profile) comprised of different string components that can potentially reflect the Android author’s style. Using these author signatures, we can effectively detect a wide range of existing, as well as any new, malware samples generated by particular authors.

Since Android Marshmallow, users have grown accustomed to authenticating with their biometrics, such as their fingerprints, facial scans, and iris recognition. Within Android, the FingerprintManager allows developers to use the fingerprint hardware to authorize a user, but it isn’t built for the other authentication options. In Android Pie, the introduction of the BiometricPrompt API promises to simplify the authentication process. After this talk, you will know how to use the BiometricPrompt, the similarities it shares with the deprecated FingerprintManager, and their differences.

There are so many convenient development tools such as Jetpack. However, when it comes to Camera2, there’s still a big hurdle for newcomers to understand the whole picture of how it works and what can be possible. One reason why Camera2 confuses developers is that there are many callbacks that we have to manage just to take one picture. In this session, I’m giving you a guide to understanding this complex system so that you can develop and customize your own Camera app. I’m going to explain the step by step photo shooting flow by looking into how each callback interacts with a Camera device. Then, I will dive into more advanced usage such as how to customize settings and add OpenGL shading into the process of shooting a photo or video.

But over time, new features came into play, network calls, asynchronous processing, your little baby turned out to be a monster and you loose yourself in the code, it’s not possible to tell in which state your app is between network calls, errors, user interactions, etc.. You’re lost ! Grox is an open source library (https://github.com/groupon/grox) that helps to manage the state of Kotlin / Java / Android applications. Inspired by Flux and Redux, Grox lets you express state changes in a testable and homogenous way. Grox offers a flexible, scalable way to manage the state of your application. With Grox you know in which exact state you are at any point in time, and you state will be represented clearly. Grox also offers time travel debugging, and a nice Rx API that plays very well with RxBinding and asynchronous code. In this session, we will explain why Grox is nice, give a few examples to use it, test your code and enjoy it’s scalability. You will see that Grox is a breeze to manage from the simplest app to the most complex ones.

In this talk, we will explore how a ridesharing app works. We will ask questions such as: How do we find out where the passenger is located? How do we discover our destination? How do we find the closest driver? How do we provide a correct ETA to the passenger in heavy traffic? How do we display this information on a map? How do we find the best route to the destination? To answer these questions, we will be learning about a variety of location APIs, including Maps, Positioning, Geocoding, Routing, Traffic, Places, and much more.

But what does that mean? And really, who’s going to say, nah, that making-customers-happy-stuff, that’s not really for me. Nobody. Ever. But incredible customer experience is also incredibly difficult to pull off. Because it is the sum of a million minute decisions that come down to this one basic principle: Make life easier for the customer. Which really means: Remove all points of friction along every step of the way. Onboarding for most apps is the worst part of the whole app experience. Users hate doing it, developers hate writing it; but it’s important! Onboarding is the first impression any app has to delight and excite users to come on board. This talk focus on how we use Kotlin + RxJava + SmartLock as well as the right amount of customer knowledge to get users into our app as smoothly as possible.

Any app that wants to go beyond simple user interactions and perform even basic functions like network or disk access, is multithreaded. We usually use provided abstractions to handle this for us, and rarely peek under the hood.

Faced with exactly this question for the Airbnb reservation system, we designed a server-driven UI framework for web, iOS, and Android that allows us to launch new types of reservations on all platforms with a simple backend change. It uses a commonly shared API that is parsed on the client and rendered into a set of corresponding components supported on all platforms. In this talk, I will discuss how we designed this multi-platform system to provide the flexibility needed to launch new types of reservations and UI components, while keeping boilerplate client code to a minimum. Using a common API across all platforms, this type of server-driven UI framework hits the sweet spot of customizability while minimizing redundant client-side work. Moreover, I’ll explain how this system has enabled us to deploy new features on all platforms simultaneously via a simple backend change, without having to release new versions of the native apps. In the code deep dive, I’ll go through the API that is used on all three platforms, how the polymorphic API response is parsed on Android, and how those data models are rendered into a reservation using Epoxy, Airbnb’s open-source library for rendering models in a RecyclerView. Finally, I’ll touch on some expanded use cases of this concept, such as multi-screen user flows for forms.

Topic - Compassionate—Yet Candid—Code Reviews Speaker - April Wensel Twitter - https://twitter.com/aprilwensel Bio - April Wensel is an international speaker and the founder of Compassionate Coding, a conscious business that helps technical teams cultivate sustainable, human-­centered software development practices built on a foundation of emotional intelligence. She has spent the past decade as a software engineer and technical leader at various startups in Silicon Valley, building products in such fields as healthcare, education, gaming, and user research. As an advocate for a more socially responsible tech industry, she also mentors technologists around the world and volunteers with organizations to teach coding to people from underrepresented groups. When not coding or speaking, she enjoys writing, running ultramarathons, and experimenting with vegan recipes. Abstract - Code reviews are essential for maintaining code quality and helping developers sharpen their coding skills. However, code reviews are also difficult to get right. Many code review comments end up being unclear, trivial, or condescending. With compassion as a guideline, though, we can work to establish code review practices that minimize suffering for everyone involved—the code authors, the code reviewers, the code maintainers, and even the end users. In this talk, you’ll learn that Compassionate Code Reviews are not about “sugarcoating” feedback and actually demand a considerable degree of candor. Equipped with a set of guidelines for executing Compassionate Code Reviews, you’ll leave inspired to apply them on your team to create better code and happier coders.

Abstract - Siri Shortcuts help to improve your user experience by making actions available with Siri in iOS, watchOS, CarPlay and HomePod. We can set up our apps to give easy access to frequent actions without needing to open the app. Even better, iOS can suggest frequently used actions pro-actively using notifications or the lock screen. We’ll see how to add custom Siri Shortcuts to our apps, how to expose them so that Siri can recommend them, and how to let users set up their own voice commands to access their favourite Shortcuts.

He has worked in several startup companies and is now working at FOLIO. At work, he tends to think about the best architecture of the app he’s working on. After work, he contributes to open source libraries such as swiftlang and OpenAPI generator. When he is not coding, you can meet him at meet-ups in Tokyo or is he travels around both in Japan and abroad. Abstract - It has been three years since Swift was first introduced. Yet there are still missing features and unfixed bugs. The good news is that Swift is open source and we, the community have the power to fix it. In this talk, I’ll discuss how to pitch an idea in Swift Forums, submit a Proposal, and how to build, test and benchmark Swift using the example of Dictionary.compactMapValues that I proposed and got merged for Swift 5.

Swift NYC Conference 2018 - try! Swift is an immersive community gathering about Apple Technologies, Swift Language Best Practices, Application Development in Swift, Server-Side Swift, Open Source Swift, and the Swift Community in New York! Topic - SwiftNIO and Network.framework Speaker - Johannes Weiss Twitter - https://twitter.com/johannesweiss Bio - Johannes Weiss is a software engineer at Apple, working on the SwiftNIO project. Abstract - SwiftNIO was developed with a focus on providing useful, high-performance tools for building event-driven networking applications on the server side. It turns out that these primitives also work well in client applications. While the primitives transfer over, the networking environment is very different, and the socket layer, which works well in a server environment, is substantially less suited to operating on mobile clients. For this reason, SwiftNIO provides integration with the brand new Network.framework on Apple’s client devices: a modern network stack for a mobile age. This talk will discuss the powerful tools that Network.framework provides, and how SwiftNIO exposes them. It’ll discuss the different design tradeoffs between server and client side, and cover some of the key differences in the networking environments. Finally, this talk will look to the future, and discuss how the server and client worlds could converge over time. Presentation Link - Will be updated soon try!

Abstract - When developing an iOS application, you rarely do not use libraries or framework.We use OS provided frameworks such like UIKit and Swift standard libraries. We also use useful third-party libraries.aAt the same time, everyone may have suffered from link errors, duplicate symbols, weird error messages from package managers.It is difficult to solve link errors because the cause of the problem comes from various things such as project setting, the library is static or dynamic, distribution method of the library or execution environment (on device or simulator). Learning the mechanism of the link makes you possible to solve the problems.

Topic - Graphics like Pixar using SwiftSpeaker - Michael Petrie Twitter - https://twitter.com/kapsy1312 Bio - My name is Michael Petrie, but everyone calls me Kapsy. I work for ZOZO Technologies and lead the iOS measurement framework team. I have a background in games and real time programming, using C and C++, and yearn for the day when we can all decide on a common ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) and be happy. Abstract - This is a talk about some of the hurdles faced when writing a simple Ray Tracer from scratch, using Swift.Ray Tracing is the cornerstone of Pixar’s infamous Renderman 3D rendering technology, which dominates the animated film industry. It works by physically modeling light rays and their interactions with objects and surfaces. Within recent years there has been a renewed interest in real time Ray Tracing, with the advent of more powerful and specialized hardware such as NVIDIAs RTX. Even renowned programmer John Carmack has stated that “”all roads lead to Rome””, when asked about the future of real time computer graphics and Ray Tracing. While I enjoy working with traditional graphics rasterizers, I have always been interested in physically modeling light, and have wanted to learn more about the processes involved. Here I talk about how I programmed a Ray Tracer that renders a simple scene from first principles. Given the timing, it also seemed like the perfect opportunity to test the versatility of Swift.

Topic - Generics in protocol extensionSpeaker - Hikaru Yoshimura Twitter - https://twitter.com/_yuu_ Bio - Hikaru Yoshimura works as a Scala engineer. He used to study type systems when he was in the university so he can program using some functional languages a little bit. He sometimes brings the good parts of languages like Scala, Haskell or OCaml to Swift. Abstract - The protocol only handle existensial type like associateType. For some protocol, when we give some functions in protocol extension, we must put a concreate type. Protocol extension will work like searching function based on type, so it’s needed concreate type in somewhere. For example, for some type called A, sometimes we want to write extension using List[A] finaly. In this talk, I’d like to consider how to create generics by force from existensial type like associatedType by using Curry-Howard correspondence.

He also initiated the Core Value and SourceKittenDaemon open source projects Abstract - Keypaths were added in Swift 4. They’re a fantastic feature but sometimes it feels difficult to find good situations for using them. However, when understood and used the right way, keypaths allow you to implement additional abstractions into your codebase that would be much harder with generics or protocols. In order to be able to do that, though, it is useful to intuitively understand when to apply the Keypath pattern. This talk will first explain the different types of keypaths that exist and then go through real world examples to showcase how they can be leveraged in your own projects.

Topic - Swift type metadataSpeaker - Yuta Saito Twitter - https://twitter.com/kateinoigakukun Bio - Yuta is an intern at Mercari’s iOS team. He gets lost with Swift everyday in the beautiful world of types. His hobby recently is to read the Swift compiler. Abstract - Swift has type metadata, which can be stored type infomation on runtime. We don’t use directly not so much, but it’s important to understand the behavior of Swift runtime. In this talk, I’d like to talk about the type metadata and its implementation.

She also makes technology accessible for entrepreneurs and startups through technical coaching at MENNENIA and Beluga Bean. Abstract - Why do we really write code? I’ve been wondering: how long is code suppose to live, and just how disposable is it? If our end goal is to deliver great and useful features for our users, is it worth writing disposable code to get to robust code? As good programmers we hone our craft, but let’s look at how can we put all that knowledge to good use so we build the right things, rather than just building things right. try!
