<p>Recording brought to you by American Express <a href="https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs</a><br>When Kotlin hit the Android scene, one of the first things many of us did was wrap difficult-to-use Android Framework APIs with extension functions. That little sprinkle of Kotlin made all the difference, and life was great — we finally we had a way to make our least favorite calls more concise and easier to work with!</p>
<p>Android KTX builds on this same idea and makes them available to everyone. It’s a new set of open source Kotlin extensions (maintained by Google) that sits on top of commonly used Framework methods, abstracting much of the complexity and boilerplate away. This vastly improves the conciseness and readability of your code, making it more idiomatic and enjoyable to work with.</p>
<p>In this talk we’ll start with a brief intro to KTX — what it is, why it’s so great, and what it means for us as Android developers. Next we’ll take a tour of what extensions are currently available, highlighting some of my favorites. We’ll compare the old, hard ways of doing things against the new, friendlier ways that KTX provides so you can clearly see how life with KTX is better!</p>
<p>By the end you’ll have a better idea of 1) how you can improve your Android code by using KTX in your daily work and 2) what well-designed extension methods look like so you can wrap/extend the Android framework for your own use (or to contribute back into KTX!)</p>
<p>About the Presenter:<br>Dan Kim has been an Android programmer at Basecamp for four years, and prior to that had been working on Java for…a long time. He’s always enjoyed Android development, but working with Kotlin over the last two years has rocketed that enthusiasm to a whole new level. The Android community has been instrumental to his work and career, and he’s a big believer in paying that forward. Outside of work, he’s an avid Dad 👴, donut aficionado 🍩, pizza lover 🍕, and emoji enthusiast 😉.</p>

<p>Recording brought to you by American Express <a href="https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs</a><br>Let’s see how Kotlin Coroutines are used to solve real-life concurrency and coordination problems. With coroutines we don’t have to worry about shared mutable state and synchronization. We can solve the problems we face using a number of communicating coroutines, where each piece of state is confined to a single coroutine.</p>
<p>About the Presenter:<br>Roman Elizarov is a professional software developer with more than 17 years of experience. He had started his career at Devexperts, where he designed and developed high-performance trading software for leading brokerage firms and market data delivery services that routinely handle millions of events per second. He is an expert in Java and JVM, particularly in real-time data processing, algorithms and performance optimizations for modern architectures. Roman currently works on Kotlin language at JetBrains. Having worked on very large systems compromising many modules written in different languages, he has a dream of a single language that can be used to write all parts of a very large distributed system, to share and reuse data models and algorithms without friction. Kotlin with JVM and JS backends and upcoming native compiler is the ideal candidate to realize this dream. In 2000 Roman had graduated from St. Petersburg ITMO. He now teaches a course on concurrent and distributed programming in ITMO. During his undergraduate study he participated at ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC). Since 1997 and until now Roman serves as a Chief Judge of Northeastern European Regional Programming Contest.</p>

<p>Recording brought to you by American Express <a href="https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs</a><br>Coroutines may be seen as a replacement of reactive programming. Both of them offer the possibility to create asynchronous applications although in a very different way. Does it still make sense to use reactive programming in Kotlin? Or can we just stick with coroutines and forget all about other asynchronous applications approaches? Or maybe we can mix both of them, take their best parts and come up with a solution which is superior to any of the two?</p>
<p>In this session we’ll learn the differences between coroutines and reactive programming. We’ll see when one shines and the other… is not so great. We’ll look under the hood to find out the reasons behind some design decisions and how those decisions affect performance and interoperability. We’ll try to decide when we should use coroutines and when the reactive programming model is better.</p>
<p>About the Presenter:<br>Konrad Kamiński is a software engineer working at Allegro, a major Polish e-commerce company. He has 20 years of experience in the IT industry in various roles (mostly as a developer and a technical leader) in software companies. He spent the last 17 years of his career with Java-related technologies. For the past two years he’s used Kotlin as his primary programming language (with delight). He blogs a bit, gives talks and trainings and contributes to open source.</p>

<p>Recording brought to you by American Express <a href="https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs</a><br>Unit Testing in Kotlin is fun and tricky at the same time. We can benefit a lot from Kotlin’s powerful language features to write readable and concise unit tests. But in order to write idiomatic Kotlin test code in the first place, there is a certain test setup required. We’ll talk about test lifecycles, mocking challenges, proper assertion libraries, the power of data classes and about spring integration. This talk contains best practices and guidelines to write unit test code in Kotlin that is idiomatic, readable, concise and produces reasonable failure messages.</p>
<p>About the Presenter:<br>Philipp Hauer works as a team lead for Spreadshirt in Leipzig, Germany. He focuses on developing JVM-based web applications and is enthusiastic about Kotlin, clean code, architectures and the sociology of software development. Moreover, Philipp is a keen blogger and tweets from time to time.</p>

<p>Recording brought to you by American Express <a href="https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs</a><br>Many will say: “Building microservices is hard!”. But with the right set of tools, technologies and frameworks it appeared to be not the case. During this session we’ll talk about modern microservices in general and how Kotlin helped us.</p>
<p>We’ll talk about Java Interoperability which allowed us to use all the goods of Java ecosystem. How building different Kotlin DSLs helped us to manage our infrastructure and orchestrate microservices. And finally how to manage this Kotlin code base in an efficient manner.</p>

These features could not be built using similar, but more limited, mechanisms, such as annotation processing.</p>
<p>The Kotlin compiler plugin API is not currently well-documented, but that doesn’t mean that it can’t be explored! In this talk, we start from scratch and show how we can build a compiler plugin and deploy an artifact to a public location, so that we can build plugins that can be applied as easily as the official compiler plugins.</p>

<p>Recording brought to you by American Express <a href="https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs</a><br>Coming from Java, Kotlin’s type system can appear quite daunting: nullable types, Unit, Nothing, Any, variance specifiers, function types, and more. But don’t panic! Kotlin’s type hierarchy is actually simple – it has very few rules to learn and those rules combine together consistently and predictably. Thanks to those rules, Kotlin useful language features, such as null safety and unreachable code analysis, do not rely on special cases that you must memorise, or ad-hoc checks in the compiler and IDE that stop working when your code gets too complicated.</p>
<p>In this talk Nat takes you on a tour of Kotlin’s type hierarchy and demonstrate how to use it to model your application domains, using example code taken from real projects.</p>
<p>About the Presenteer:<br>Nat Pryce has been programming for <em>coughty-cough</em> years, and programming in Kotlin since it was in beta. He introduced Kotlin into his current client and his team used it to deliver business-critical, customer-facing web applications. Now many teams in the company are happy users of Kotlin, and it powers many of their core services.</p>

<p>Recording brought to you by American Express <a href="https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs</a><br>This presentation uses live coding to show how to implement and implement a CQRS architecture using functional abstractions, pure functions and immutable data using Kotlin as language. CQRS concepts go very well together with functional programming principles of immutability and high level functions. Participants don’t have to know Kotlin or functional programming but the knowledge can be beneficial. The session tries to capture the main architecture critical decision in implementing a cqrs application. We also believe that using a functional approach simplify the code and avoid some typical pitfalls in event store implementations. Of course it can bring to other problems so we discuss those as well.</p>
