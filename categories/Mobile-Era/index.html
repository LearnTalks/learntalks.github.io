<p>In Norigin Media we are developing TV Streaming Apps for all relevant platforms (pretty much everything where it is possible to stream videos). After many years of doing these kind of Apps we’ve tried to find common patterns between different Players, UX patterns for TV Apps, Tracking/Analytics systems and other common issues that we had to deal with over and over again. We abstracted and isolated many of them into a small reusable and replaceable modules and built an in-house ecosystem that allows us to improve our crossplatform development process and make developers’ lives easier. We care a lot about Developer Experience, which is the main motivation for us to build such a tools and solutions.</p>

<p>Optimizing image content for every browser and device size can be difficult. Random cropping of images can lead to losing context and features (sometimes as extreme as lopping off the heads of your subjects). In this talk it will be presented how AI can be used to identify the important content in each image, allowing for smart cropping of images. This allows to optimize images further than perviously possible, shrinking page size, and speeding up page load times.</p>
<p>About the speaker<br>Doug is is a freelance mobile performance expert, having helped thousands of developers speed up their mobile apps and websites. A Google Developer Expert and the author of O’Reilly’s “High Performance Android Apps,” Doug regularly speaks at conferences, and blogs at dougsillars.com. He is currently working as a freelance digital nomad, traveling with his family in Europe.</p>

This session is very important to developers of all kinds!</p>

<p>My team maintains video data libraries that we use to instrument video playback in the major Twitter clients (iOS, Android, and Web). Those libraries are written natively, but follow the same logic and design patterns across all three. We’re interested in trying to figure out the feasibility of doing a “write once, run everywhere” solution where we implement the logic once and then either transpile or run in an interpreter that library on each client. We looked into using JavaScript, Kotlin, C++, and Rust, each one has their advantages and disadvantages. In my talk, I will run through the advantages and disadvantages of each of these languages. Being at the scale Twitter has its own unique challenges, such as sensitivity to app startup time, size, and responsiveness, that we needed to factor into our decisions of language. This is a project we haven’t started working on yet, but we are playing on starting it between now and the conference.</p>

<p>It was a cold day in December of 2018, I was sitting with my developer friends at a local pub in Oslo. Inspired by our conversations, I got the idea to finally fix the “Tinder problem”. We’re all so tired of swiping, it’s about time we automated this thing!</p>
<p>Never did I imagine what I’d get myself into, the intrigues and the drama that would follow. Sure, investigating the Tinder API was easy enough. Sure, building an Azure function and deploying it to the cloud to fully automate Tinder was not a big deal. But finding exposed personal information from the Tinder API, a security threat in the OAuth 2.0 protocol and eventually getting my account locked by Facebook?! Taking down Tinder by accident and seeing this event unfold all over the media?!</p>
<p>Never did I imagine I’d have so much fun and learn so much along the way, building my automated Tinder cloud app.</p>
<p>Sit back, relax and come watch my talk. You’re in for a wild ride!</p>
