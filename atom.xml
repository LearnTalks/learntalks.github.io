After many years of doing these kind of Apps we’ve tried to find common patterns between different Players, UX patterns for TV Apps, Tracking/Analytics systems and other common issues that we had to deal with over and over again. We abstracted and isolated many of them into a small reusable and replaceable modules and built an in-house ecosystem that allows us to improve our crossplatform development process and make developers’ lives easier. We care a lot about Developer Experience, which is the main motivation for us to build such a tools and solutions.</p><p>About the speaker<br>I am a Frontend Engineer at Norigin Media, working on crossplatform TV Streaming Apps and in-house SDK components.

Random cropping of images can lead to losing context and features (sometimes as extreme as lopping off the heads of your subjects). In this talk it will be presented how AI can be used to identify the important content in each image, allowing for smart cropping of images. This allows to optimize images further than perviously possible, shrinking page size, and speeding up page load times.</p><p>About the speaker<br>Doug is is a freelance mobile performance expert, having helped thousands of developers speed up their mobile apps and websites. A Google Developer Expert and the author of O’Reilly’s “High Performance Android Apps,” Doug regularly speaks at conferences, and blogs at dougsillars.com.

Those libraries are written natively, but follow the same logic and design patterns across all three. We’re interested in trying to figure out the feasibility of doing a “write once, run everywhere” solution where we implement the logic once and then either transpile or run in an interpreter that library on each client. We looked into using JavaScript, Kotlin, C++, and Rust, each one has their advantages and disadvantages. In my talk, I will run through the advantages and disadvantages of each of these languages. Being at the scale Twitter has its own unique challenges, such as sensitivity to app startup time, size, and responsiveness, that we needed to factor into our decisions of language.

Inspired by our conversations, I got the idea to finally fix the “Tinder problem”. We’re all so tired of swiping, it’s about time we automated this thing!</p><p>Never did I imagine what I’d get myself into, the intrigues and the drama that would follow. Sure, investigating the Tinder API was easy enough. Sure, building an Azure function and deploying it to the cloud to fully automate Tinder was not a big deal. But finding exposed personal information from the Tinder API, a security threat in the OAuth 2.0 protocol and eventually getting my account locked by Facebook?! Taking down Tinder by accident and seeing this event unfold all over the media?!</p><p>Never did I imagine I’d have so much fun and learn so much along the way, building my automated Tinder cloud app.</p><p>Sit back, relax and come watch my talk.

As a Mobile Developer Experience engineer, it has become my job to turn “it would be nice…” into production products &amp; processes that save every iOS engineer time. From investing in CI architecture, build tools, and internal documentation, we’ll cover all the ways you can help empower your team to be productive, and turn complaints into quality-of-life improvements on a daily basis.</p><p>About the speaker<br>Samuel is a developer well-versed in the rituals of writing developer tools that occasionally work. By day, Samuel works on making the mobile developer experience at Square less arduous; by night he can be found breaking Bundler and CocoaPods. Before this whole “developer” thing, Samuel studied in the highly impractical Mathematics &amp; Economics departments at UChicago, learning subjects such as “numbers”, “social theory”, and “memes”. When not coding, Samuel is often in the kitchen, marveling at the fact that dinner smells better than it looks.</p><p>About Mobile Era<br>Mobile Era is organized by a team of enthusiasts across several technology companies in Oslo.
