Random cropping of images can lead to losing context and features (sometimes as extreme as lopping off the heads of your subjects). In this talk it will be presented how AI can be used to identify the important content in each image, allowing for smart cropping of images. This allows to optimize images further than perviously possible, shrinking page size, and speeding up page load times.</p><p>About the speaker<br>Doug is is a freelance mobile performance expert, having helped thousands of developers speed up their mobile apps and websites.

Those libraries are written natively, but follow the same logic and design patterns across all three. We’re interested in trying to figure out the feasibility of doing a “write once, run everywhere” solution where we implement the logic once and then either transpile or run in an interpreter that library on each client. We looked into using JavaScript, Kotlin, C++, and Rust, each one has their advantages and disadvantages. In my talk, I will run through the advantages and disadvantages of each of these languages. Being at the scale Twitter has its own unique challenges, such as sensitivity to app startup time, size, and responsiveness, that we needed to factor into our decisions of language. This is a project we haven’t started working on yet, but we are playing on starting it between now and the conference.</p><p>About the speaker<br>Justin does mainly iOS at Twitter.

Inspired by our conversations, I got the idea to finally fix the “Tinder problem”. We’re all so tired of swiping, it’s about time we automated this thing!</p><p>Never did I imagine what I’d get myself into, the intrigues and the drama that would follow. Sure, investigating the Tinder API was easy enough. Sure, building an Azure function and deploying it to the cloud to fully automate Tinder was not a big deal. But finding exposed personal information from the Tinder API, a security threat in the OAuth 2.0 protocol and eventually getting my account locked by Facebook?! Taking down Tinder by accident and seeing this event unfold all over the media?!</p><p>Never did I imagine I’d have so much fun and learn so much along the way, building my automated Tinder cloud app.</p><p>Sit back, relax and come watch my talk. You’re in for a wild ride!</p><p>About the speaker<br>Sirar Salih is CTO with primary focus on Azure initiatives at Itera and a Microsoft Azure MVP.

Especially when we take into mind that a big part of the world population can only access the Internet via their smartphone. This talk explores the theoretical background of animation, the limitations and opportunities animations brings when done in the mobile browser, the connection of animation to touch gestures and some practical code examples of how animation can be incorporated into mobile websites. This talk is backed by a lot of science, theory and experience, since I wrote my master thesis in this field, which was titled ‘Touch Interaction and Animation in Mobile Web Interfaces’. During the thesis I developed a mobile PWA that looked similar to native application (<a href="http://masterthesis.lisilinhart.info" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://masterthesis.lisilinhart.info</a>) and conducted a user study that A / B tested this prototype with and without animation. I feel that the insight I gained during the research can be transformed into an insightful talk, that’s especially compelling for developers who are interested in usability, animation and touch interaction in the mobile web browser. A common question that guided this research was how to make websites feel more like native applications.</p><p>About the speaker<br>Lisi is a lecturer for web development at the University of Applied Sciences in Salzburg, Austria, where she teaches students everything there is to know about front-end development and design. In her free time you will often find her at conferences, attending or speaking about web animation. Other than coding and design, she also loves to spend her free time drawing and illustrating.</p><p>About Mobile Era<br>Mobile Era is organized by a team of enthusiasts across several technology companies in Oslo.

Still, writing shaders might seem intimidating at first glance. What is this strange GLSL-language, and why does all the examples resemble a badly formatted math paper? Let’s take a quick dive into shader programming, and get familiar with the basics of fragment shaders, how to create more or less planned effects, and how to use audio to breath life into simple visualizations. Although shaders might take a lifetime to master, there’s plenty of room for casual exploration and happy accidents for those of us just starting out.</p><p>About the speaker<br>Teodor works at Computas, where he’s currently busy telling everybody that Charles Moore ran a very successful consulting firm using Forth, among other things. He’s passionate about programming as an creative process, and he strongly believe that fun fosters innovation.

SwiftUI, for instance, relies heavily on it to provide its system of data-binding through annotations like @State, @EnvironmentObjects, etc. Unlike other language improvements, Codable for instance, Apple hasn’t restricted the use of this new feature to its own frameworks: any codebase is free to leverage it to implement custom property attributes that will suit its own specific needs. While this is a great opportunity to factorise common behaviours throughout a project, one can still wonder: won’t it hurt code readability and predictability on the long run? Keeping code short is good, but if it’s achieved through a collection of arcane annotations, it might end up defying the original intent.</p><p>About the speaker<br>Vincent started working on iOS apps back in 2011. For the last years, he’s been working at Worldline, where he contributes to building great apps for major French banks. He loves Swift and enjoys sharing about it on the Internet. Most notably, he built the framework KeyPathKit that implements a SQL-like syntax for data manipulation. He is also the person behind the Twitter account @ios_memes.</p><p>About Mobile Era<br>Mobile Era is organized by a team of enthusiasts across several technology companies in Oslo.

As with any system, it’s important to maintain good Unit &amp; Integration test coverage - and this is usually not too difficult. UI and System tests, however, can be non-trivial when taking into consideration the multitudes of available frameworks. In this situation, how much time do we spend evaluating each framework? How much time do we spend developing and integrating them into our CI flow, and how do we make sure we get value from doing so? In this talk, I will be showing how we have gone through this process for both the Android, and AndroidTV applications for NRKTV. I will mention which frameworks we use and why, where and when we run these tests, and what value this has given us. Hopefully, this can inspire others to invest time and energy to try and achieve a similar level of quality control in their applications.</p><p>About Mobile Era<br>Mobile Era is organized by a team of enthusiasts across several technology companies in Oslo.

The once text based, largely academic platform had just a few concerns: content and an internet connection. As long as we had a free phone line, we could in relative comfort, download information being posted to the web - say like Craig Newmark’s Craigslist, launched not too long after the web emerged. But in 2019, the likes of Craigslist and loading plain text are long behind us. We introduced web fonts, javascript, images but more importantly: the now ubiquitous mobile device and all it’s limitations. In light of current media rich sites, resource loading is now faced with unimaginable friction of all types:</p><pre><code>capricious mobile network connectionsmismanaged asset sizesa diverse array of device types, and screen densities.splintered support for new technologies.Content Management Systems</code></pre><p>Compounding the complication has been the liberal use of libraries and the abundance of new element attributes. ‘2019: An Odyssey In Modern Resource Loading’ will be a look at what has been done, leading to present-day and even future web development, all in the name of reducing all known friction. From web fonts, Retina™ images, and of course javascript, this talk will discuss the recent updates available to developers such as, but not limited to: resource and priority hints, image decoding prioritization, responsive images preloading. We will present reasons why they were implemented and are considered best practice, all accounting for updated browser support and landscape.</p><p>About the speaker:<br>Henri is a freelance developer who has turned his interests to a passionate mix of site performance engineering and pinches of user experience, which have a considerable impact on the mobile landscape. When not reading the deluge of daily research docs and case studies. Henri can be found contributing back to the community: Toronto Web Performance Group meetup + SPOTLIGHT: PERFORMANCE conference co-organizer, curating content for conferences or volunteering his time for lunch and learns at various boot camps - all with a radiant smile. Otherwise, he’s focusing on running the fastest 5k possible (surprise surprise).</p><p>About Mobile Era<br>Mobile Era is organized by a team of enthusiasts across several technology companies in Oslo.

At Uber, we work with multiple apps that are deployed in multiple markets and localized in over 50 languages, which rely heavily on correctness and safety of String. We’ve also built multiple code generators and other developer tools that involve a large amount of String processing, and thus String performance can have a huge impact. This talk will discuss various scenarios where we encountered pitfalls of Swift Strings, and the methods we used to resolve challenges from both the correctness and performance perspectives. It will also cover what you can do for your apps or tools to safeguard and optimize if you use Strings a lot.</p><p>About the speaker<br>Ellie is a senior iOS Engineer at Uber on the mobile platform team. She has worked on building Uber’s rider app and tools including code generators. She cares deeply about optimizing iOS apps and frameworks at scale. She has previously worked at Spotify and Microsoft among other companies, primarily on iOS. She has given talks at UIKonf, NSSpain, and other conferences, on iOS app binary size optimization, efficient code generation, and Swift String performance.</p><p>About Mobile Era<br>Mobile Era is organized by a team of enthusiasts across several technology companies in Oslo.
