After many years of doing these kind of Apps we’ve tried to find common patterns between different Players, UX patterns for TV Apps, Tracking/Analytics systems and other common issues that we had to deal with over and over again. We abstracted and isolated many of them into a small reusable and replaceable modules and built an in-house ecosystem that allows us to improve our crossplatform development process and make developers’ lives easier. We care a lot about Developer Experience, which is the main motivation for us to build such a tools and solutions.</p><p>About the speaker<br>I am a Frontend Engineer at Norigin Media, working on crossplatform TV Streaming Apps and in-house SDK components.

Random cropping of images can lead to losing context and features (sometimes as extreme as lopping off the heads of your subjects). In this talk it will be presented how AI can be used to identify the important content in each image, allowing for smart cropping of images. This allows to optimize images further than perviously possible, shrinking page size, and speeding up page load times.</p><p>About the speaker<br>Doug is is a freelance mobile performance expert, having helped thousands of developers speed up their mobile apps and websites.

Those libraries are written natively, but follow the same logic and design patterns across all three. We’re interested in trying to figure out the feasibility of doing a “write once, run everywhere” solution where we implement the logic once and then either transpile or run in an interpreter that library on each client. We looked into using JavaScript, Kotlin, C++, and Rust, each one has their advantages and disadvantages. In my talk, I will run through the advantages and disadvantages of each of these languages. Being at the scale Twitter has its own unique challenges, such as sensitivity to app startup time, size, and responsiveness, that we needed to factor into our decisions of language. This is a project we haven’t started working on yet, but we are playing on starting it between now and the conference.</p><p>About the speaker<br>Justin does mainly iOS at Twitter.

Inspired by our conversations, I got the idea to finally fix the “Tinder problem”. We’re all so tired of swiping, it’s about time we automated this thing!</p><p>Never did I imagine what I’d get myself into, the intrigues and the drama that would follow. Sure, investigating the Tinder API was easy enough. Sure, building an Azure function and deploying it to the cloud to fully automate Tinder was not a big deal. But finding exposed personal information from the Tinder API, a security threat in the OAuth 2.0 protocol and eventually getting my account locked by Facebook?! Taking down Tinder by accident and seeing this event unfold all over the media?!</p><p>Never did I imagine I’d have so much fun and learn so much along the way, building my automated Tinder cloud app.</p><p>Sit back, relax and come watch my talk. You’re in for a wild ride!</p><p>About the speaker<br>Sirar Salih is CTO with primary focus on Azure initiatives at Itera and a Microsoft Azure MVP.

As with any system, it’s important to maintain good Unit &amp; Integration test coverage - and this is usually not too difficult. UI and System tests, however, can be non-trivial when taking into consideration the multitudes of available frameworks. In this situation, how much time do we spend evaluating each framework? How much time do we spend developing and integrating them into our CI flow, and how do we make sure we get value from doing so? In this talk, I will be showing how we have gone through this process for both the Android, and AndroidTV applications for NRKTV. I will mention which frameworks we use and why, where and when we run these tests, and what value this has given us. Hopefully, this can inspire others to invest time and energy to try and achieve a similar level of quality control in their applications.</p><p>About Mobile Era<br>Mobile Era is organized by a team of enthusiasts across several technology companies in Oslo.

Profiler have always been the hidden tool, which we often neglect and then wonder why do we have lower app ratings.

At Uber, we work with multiple apps that are deployed in multiple markets and localized in over 50 languages, which rely heavily on correctness and safety of String. We’ve also built multiple code generators and other developer tools that involve a large amount of String processing, and thus String performance can have a huge impact. This talk will discuss various scenarios where we encountered pitfalls of Swift Strings, and the methods we used to resolve challenges from both the correctness and performance perspectives. It will also cover what you can do for your apps or tools to safeguard and optimize if you use Strings a lot.</p><p>About the speaker<br>Ellie is a senior iOS Engineer at Uber on the mobile platform team. She has worked on building Uber’s rider app and tools including code generators. She cares deeply about optimizing iOS apps and frameworks at scale. She has previously worked at Spotify and Microsoft among other companies, primarily on iOS. She has given talks at UIKonf, NSSpain, and other conferences, on iOS app binary size optimization, efficient code generation, and Swift String performance.</p><p>About Mobile Era<br>Mobile Era is organized by a team of enthusiasts across several technology companies in Oslo.

As a backup I have video’s recorded with different accents – How to implement a voice action in React and React Native in iOS and Android with live demo (ordering 500 coffee from Starbucks or something like that) with a video as backup plan – Show how to do NPL on React and React Native and show it in the app and with weird results. Then take action or let it dictate the tekst on screen – Summary of the solutions and my opinion about the best solution</p><p>About the speaker<br>Wouter van den Broek is a dutch mobile developer and consultant currently working at Synappz Mobile Health and as freelancer for start-ups and big companies.

Still, writing shaders might seem intimidating at first glance. What is this strange GLSL-language, and why does all the examples resemble a badly formatted math paper? Let’s take a quick dive into shader programming, and get familiar with the basics of fragment shaders, how to create more or less planned effects, and how to use audio to breath life into simple visualizations. Although shaders might take a lifetime to master, there’s plenty of room for casual exploration and happy accidents for those of us just starting out.</p><p>About the speaker<br>Teodor works at Computas, where he’s currently busy telling everybody that Charles Moore ran a very successful consulting firm using Forth, among other things. He’s passionate about programming as an creative process, and he strongly believe that fun fosters innovation. When he’s not coding for hire, he enjoys making programs that run for a while and only makes the machine hot. In the future he hopes to eliminate this unfortunate side-effect as well.</p><p>About Mobile Era<br>Mobile Era is organized by a team of enthusiasts across several technology companies in Oslo.
