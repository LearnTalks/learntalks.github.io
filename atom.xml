We’ll discuss the benefits of Vapor 4 and server-side Swift. In a live demo we’ll build an application to show how easy it is to use Vapor. Finally in the demo, you’ll see how to share code between iOS and your Vapor application</p><p>About the speaker</p><p>Tim is a Swift developer from Manchester, UK. He’s the server-side Swift team lead at raywenderlich.com and has written the unofficial-official book on Vapor with the founders of the framework. He founded Broken Hands a few years ago delivers talks and workshops on Vapor and server-side Swift around the world. He also co-organises the ServerSide.swift conference - the world’s first and only conference focused on server-side Swift.</p><p>Event URL: <a href="https://2020.iosconf.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://2020.iosconf.sg/</a></p><p>Produced by Engineers.SG</p>]]></content>

With them, any codebase is now free to define custom property attributes that will suit its own needs. In this talk, Vincent will discuss how they we can be efficiently leveraged, while avoiding pitfalls.</p><p>About the speaker</p><p>Vincent started working on iOS apps back in 2011. For the last years, he’s been working at Worldline, where he contributes to building great apps for major French banks. He loves Swift and enjoys sharing about it on the Internet. Most notably, he built the framework KeyPathKit that implements a SQL-like syntax for data manipulation. He’s also the one behind the Twitter account @ios_memes.</p><p>Event URL: <a href="https://2020.iosconf.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://2020.iosconf.sg/</a></p><p>Produced by Engineers.SG</p>]]></content>

This talk will explore how we can form a declarative networking layer using Combine. We will take advantage of the existing combine operators like DataTaskPublisher, Just, Fail, Catch, etc to define (i.e. validate and parse) success and error streams declaratively.</p><p>About the speaker</p><p>Ritesh is a Mobile Engineering Manager at Fueled, working remotely from somewhere in India (currently Bangalore). He has been developing iOS applications since 2013 and occasionally delves into Kotlin. He enjoys reactive programming and also writes about it on his personal blog riteshhh.com. He also had the honor of writing one complete issue (295th) of iOS dev weekly &amp; has given multiple talks in various meetups/conferences. When he is not coding, you can find him exploring street food or food markets.</p><p>Event URL: <a href="https://2020.iosconf.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://2020.iosconf.sg/</a></p><p>Produced by Engineers.SG</p>]]></content>

Tumblr is an interest-based social network, and most people on it begin as strangers. Building technology that allows people - strangers - to connect so deeply is a privilege. Apps are the infrastructure for many of our communities. And despite many people understandably losing faith in social media companies and their ability to handle their immense responsibility, new social networks are still being built and are growing in surprising ways. And they continue to deliver on something incredibly important to users - community. In this talk, she’ll be sharing some of the lessons she has learned building social media iOS apps. She’ll focus on how engineers can build strong engineering foundations for new social networks and choose the right tools, discuss foundational product principles that help encourage users to share, create, and participate, and shout out some of my favorite unlikely social networks and what they can teach us about building inspiring iOS apps.</p><p>About the speaker</p><p>Tamar Nachmany is a senior engineer at Glossier, where she has worked in iOS and across the tech stack, and previously worked on the iOS teams at Tumblr and The New York Times. When she’s not writing software she writes fiction. She is very excited to be in Singapore for the first time.</p><p>Event URL: <a href="https://2020.iosconf.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://2020.iosconf.sg/</a></p><p>Produced by Engineers.SG</p>]]></content>

Typically this requires a designer or illustrator to create one and then export it in three different resolutions. When there were only a few different iOS devices to consider, this had a low cost. By using SVG and SwiftUI, we have a great way of handling images in your apps.</p><p>About the speaker</p><p>Matt is a macOS and iOS developer based in Melbourne Australia. He has a propensity towards creating apps that are magical and delightful to use. His experiences ranges from backend to front end and feels that such breadth grants the ability to understand the intricacies involved in creating apps.</p><p>Event URL: <a href="https://2020.iosconf.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://2020.iosconf.sg/</a></p><p>Produced by Engineers.SG</p>]]></content>

How can we move away from this mess and to something more sustainable? Ellen will discuss moving a codebase like this to a command line tool that can be called from a Swift script, and which can be tested and breakpointed, and just might save a tiny bit of your sanity.</p><p>About the speaker</p><p>Ellen Shapiro is a mobile engineer for Apollo GraphQL who has been building native apps for both iOS and Android since 2010. She’s written tutorials for RayWenderlich.com about iOS and Android since 2013, and is now one of the authors of their Kotlin Apprentice book. When not coding or talking incessantly about coding, Ellen spends her time traveling, biking, playing sous-chef to her fiancée Lilia, and relentlessly instagramming their cat.</p><p>Event URL: <a href="https://2020.iosconf.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://2020.iosconf.sg/</a></p><p>Produced by Engineers.SG</p>]]></content>

Even though iOS is now more than ten years old, designing your app to be discoverable is as hard as it ever was. Learn some modern techniques for how to make sure your users <em>find</em> the features you spent so many hours implementing.</p><p>About the speaker</p><p>Dave is an independent and freelance iOS developer and author of iOS Dev Weekly. He has been developing for the Mac and iOS since 2006 and is secretly quite proud that his first professional gig had him using a (real) vt100 green screen terminal. He’s glad he doesn’t have to use that any more though!</p><p>Event URL: <a href="https://2020.iosconf.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://2020.iosconf.sg/</a></p><p>Produced by Engineers.SG</p>]]></content>
