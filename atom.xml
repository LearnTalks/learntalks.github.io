Random cropping of images can lead to losing context and features (sometimes as extreme as lopping off the heads of your subjects). In this talk it will be presented how AI can be used to identify the important content in each image, allowing for smart cropping of images. This allows to optimize images further than perviously possible, shrinking page size, and speeding up page load times.</p><p>About the speaker<br>Doug is is a freelance mobile performance expert, having helped thousands of developers speed up their mobile apps and websites.

Those libraries are written natively, but follow the same logic and design patterns across all three. We’re interested in trying to figure out the feasibility of doing a “write once, run everywhere” solution where we implement the logic once and then either transpile or run in an interpreter that library on each client. We looked into using JavaScript, Kotlin, C++, and Rust, each one has their advantages and disadvantages. In my talk, I will run through the advantages and disadvantages of each of these languages. Being at the scale Twitter has its own unique challenges, such as sensitivity to app startup time, size, and responsiveness, that we needed to factor into our decisions of language. This is a project we haven’t started working on yet, but we are playing on starting it between now and the conference.</p><p>About the speaker<br>Justin does mainly iOS at Twitter.

Inspired by our conversations, I got the idea to finally fix the “Tinder problem”. We’re all so tired of swiping, it’s about time we automated this thing!</p><p>Never did I imagine what I’d get myself into, the intrigues and the drama that would follow. Sure, investigating the Tinder API was easy enough. Sure, building an Azure function and deploying it to the cloud to fully automate Tinder was not a big deal. But finding exposed personal information from the Tinder API, a security threat in the OAuth 2.0 protocol and eventually getting my account locked by Facebook?! Taking down Tinder by accident and seeing this event unfold all over the media?!</p><p>Never did I imagine I’d have so much fun and learn so much along the way, building my automated Tinder cloud app.</p><p>Sit back, relax and come watch my talk.

At Uber, we work with multiple apps that are deployed in multiple markets and localized in over 50 languages, which rely heavily on correctness and safety of String. We’ve also built multiple code generators and other developer tools that involve a large amount of String processing, and thus String performance can have a huge impact. This talk will discuss various scenarios where we encountered pitfalls of Swift Strings, and the methods we used to resolve challenges from both the correctness and performance perspectives. It will also cover what you can do for your apps or tools to safeguard and optimize if you use Strings a lot.</p><p>About the speaker<br>Ellie is a senior iOS Engineer at Uber on the mobile platform team.

As with any system, it’s important to maintain good Unit &amp; Integration test coverage - and this is usually not too difficult. UI and System tests, however, can be non-trivial when taking into consideration the multitudes of available frameworks. In this situation, how much time do we spend evaluating each framework? How much time do we spend developing and integrating them into our CI flow, and how do we make sure we get value from doing so? In this talk, I will be showing how we have gone through this process for both the Android, and AndroidTV applications for NRKTV. I will mention which frameworks we use and why, where and when we run these tests, and what value this has given us. Hopefully, this can inspire others to invest time and energy to try and achieve a similar level of quality control in their applications.</p><p>About Mobile Era<br>Mobile Era is organized by a team of enthusiasts across several technology companies in Oslo.

As a backup I have video’s recorded with different accents – How to implement a voice action in React and React Native in iOS and Android with live demo (ordering 500 coffee from Starbucks or something like that) with a video as backup plan – Show how to do NPL on React and React Native and show it in the app and with weird results.

Especially when we take into mind that a big part of the world population can only access the Internet via their smartphone. This talk explores the theoretical background of animation, the limitations and opportunities animations brings when done in the mobile browser, the connection of animation to touch gestures and some practical code examples of how animation can be incorporated into mobile websites. This talk is backed by a lot of science, theory and experience, since I wrote my master thesis in this field, which was titled ‘Touch Interaction and Animation in Mobile Web Interfaces’. During the thesis I developed a mobile PWA that looked similar to native application (<a href="http://masterthesis.lisilinhart.info" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://masterthesis.lisilinhart.info</a>) and conducted a user study that A / B tested this prototype with and without animation. I feel that the insight I gained during the research can be transformed into an insightful talk, that’s especially compelling for developers who are interested in usability, animation and touch interaction in the mobile web browser. A common question that guided this research was how to make websites feel more like native applications.</p><p>About the speaker<br>Lisi is a lecturer for web development at the University of Applied Sciences in Salzburg, Austria, where she teaches students everything there is to know about front-end development and design. In her free time you will often find her at conferences, attending or speaking about web animation. Other than coding and design, she also loves to spend her free time drawing and illustrating.</p><p>About Mobile Era<br>Mobile Era is organized by a team of enthusiasts across several technology companies in Oslo.
