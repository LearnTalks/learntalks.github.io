<p>Recording brought to you by American Express <a href="https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs</a><br>When Kotlin hit the Android scene, one of the first things many of us did was wrap difficult-to-use Android Framework APIs with extension functions. That little sprinkle of Kotlin made all the difference, and life was great — we finally we had a way to make our least favorite calls more concise and easier to work with!</p>
<p>Android KTX builds on this same idea and makes them available to everyone. It’s a new set of open source Kotlin extensions (maintained by Google) that sits on top of commonly used Framework methods, abstracting much of the complexity and boilerplate away. This vastly improves the conciseness and readability of your code, making it more idiomatic and enjoyable to work with.</p>
<p>In this talk we’ll start with a brief intro to KTX — what it is, why it’s so great, and what it means for us as Android developers. Next we’ll take a tour of what extensions are currently available, highlighting some of my favorites. We’ll compare the old, hard ways of doing things against the new, friendlier ways that KTX provides so you can clearly see how life with KTX is better!</p>
<p>By the end you’ll have a better idea of 1) how you can improve your Android code by using KTX in your daily work and 2) what well-designed extension methods look like so you can wrap/extend the Android framework for your own use (or to contribute back into KTX!)</p>
<p>About the Presenter:<br>Dan Kim has been an Android programmer at Basecamp for four years, and prior to that had been working on Java for…a long time. He’s always enjoyed Android development, but working with Kotlin over the last two years has rocketed that enthusiasm to a whole new level. The Android community has been instrumental to his work and career, and he’s a big believer in paying that forward. Outside of work, he’s an avid Dad 👴, donut aficionado 🍩, pizza lover 🍕, and emoji enthusiast 😉.</p>

<p>Recording brought to you by American Express <a href="https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs</a><br>I talk about how and why I wanted to be an iOS mobile developer at the age of 51. How a 16 year inspired me to learn to code and the challenges I face after becoming an iOS developer being the first self-taught African American woman mobile developer to create a domestic violence app dedicated to helping victims escape abuse and how Apple found me and was highlight at WWDC 2015, 2016 keynote event and I am a developer video. Some people want to believe that people my age are out of touch with technology and as a woman.</p>
<p>About the Presenter:<br>Alicia is the first woman of color mobile developer to create a domestic violence app Purple Evolution, Inc(PEVO) dedicated to helping victims escape abuse. She used her acquired skills as a developer to make a difference. Alicia also dedicated her time to empowering women in tech with Women Who Code, she has received several major acknowledgments from Apple at WWDC15 and WWDC16 being the first black woman to be in an Apple 2016 new beginnings video and GitHub in there I am a developer video.</p>

<p>Recording brought to you by American Express <a href="https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs</a><br>Let’s see how Kotlin Coroutines are used to solve real-life concurrency and coordination problems. With coroutines we don’t have to worry about shared mutable state and synchronization. We can solve the problems we face using a number of communicating coroutines, where each piece of state is confined to a single coroutine.</p>
<p>About the Presenter:<br>Roman Elizarov is a professional software developer with more than 17 years of experience. He had started his career at Devexperts, where he designed and developed high-performance trading software for leading brokerage firms and market data delivery services that routinely handle millions of events per second. He is an expert in Java and JVM, particularly in real-time data processing, algorithms and performance optimizations for modern architectures. Roman currently works on Kotlin language at JetBrains. Having worked on very large systems compromising many modules written in different languages, he has a dream of a single language that can be used to write all parts of a very large distributed system, to share and reuse data models and algorithms without friction. Kotlin with JVM and JS backends and upcoming native compiler is the ideal candidate to realize this dream. In 2000 Roman had graduated from St. Petersburg ITMO. He now teaches a course on concurrent and distributed programming in ITMO. During his undergraduate study he participated at ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC). Since 1997 and until now Roman serves as a Chief Judge of Northeastern European Regional Programming Contest.</p>

<p>Recording brought to you by American Express <a href="https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs</a><br>Unit Testing in Kotlin is fun and tricky at the same time. We can benefit a lot from Kotlin’s powerful language features to write readable and concise unit tests. But in order to write idiomatic Kotlin test code in the first place, there is a certain test setup required. We’ll talk about test lifecycles, mocking challenges, proper assertion libraries, the power of data classes and about spring integration. This talk contains best practices and guidelines to write unit test code in Kotlin that is idiomatic, readable, concise and produces reasonable failure messages.</p>
<p>About the Presenter:<br>Philipp Hauer works as a team lead for Spreadshirt in Leipzig, Germany. He focuses on developing JVM-based web applications and is enthusiastic about Kotlin, clean code, architectures and the sociology of software development. Moreover, Philipp is a keen blogger and tweets from time to time.</p>

<p>Abstract - Code reviews are essential for maintaining code quality and helping developers sharpen their coding skills. However, code reviews are also difficult to get right. Many code review comments end up being unclear, trivial, or condescending. With compassion as a guideline, though, we can work to establish code review practices that minimize suffering for everyone involved—the code authors, the code reviewers, the code maintainers, and even the end users. In this talk, you’ll learn that Compassionate Code Reviews are not about “sugarcoating” feedback and actually demand a considerable degree of candor. Equipped with a set of guidelines for executing Compassionate Code Reviews, you’ll leave inspired to apply them on your team to create better code and happier coders.</p>

<p>Recording brought to you by American Express <a href="https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs</a><br>This presentation uses live coding to show how to implement and implement a CQRS architecture using functional abstractions, pure functions and immutable data using Kotlin as language. CQRS concepts go very well together with functional programming principles of immutability and high level functions. Participants don’t have to know Kotlin or functional programming but the knowledge can be beneficial. The session tries to capture the main architecture critical decision in implementing a cqrs application. We also believe that using a functional approach simplify the code and avoid some typical pitfalls in event store implementations. Of course it can bring to other problems so we discuss those as well.</p>

<p>Recording brought to you by American Express <a href="https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs</a><br>Playing games is fun but making games is even better, especially with Kotlin and libGDX. Let’s build together a breakout game and let’s explore the gaming framework libGDX.</p>
<p>This session will show some libGDX’s concepts: how to draw and animate elements of our game, how collision system works to destroy our bricks, what Kotlin brings to libGDX. Then we will dive into more advanced topics like shaders, in order to handle pixels from our images. Why are we doing all of this? To break the high score, of course!</p>
<p>About David Wursteisen:<br>Technologies shoudn’t be an issue. Instead it should help you to build better products</p>

<p>Recording brought to you by American Express <a href="https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs</a><br>When I spoke at KotlinConf ‘17, I presented on how we have adopted Kotlin at Hootsuite, the culture that facilitated that adoption as well as the details of our journey.</p>
<p>A side story from that presentation that ended up generating many questions from the audience both after the talk, and since returning from the conference were our tools, Atlas and Peon.</p>
<p>Atlas<br>Atlas is a tool which we use at Hootsuite to visualize dependency graphs for our Kotlin/Java Android codebase, our ObjectiveC/Swift iOS codebase, and our Scala backend codebase. Originally written in Ruby, it has been rewritten in Kotlin/JS. Atlas scrapes Github for build files for Gradle, Carthage, and SBT. It then parses the build files and generates a dependency graph from them. The dependency graph can then be visualized as a PNG using graphviz or it can feed the graph to our Peon tool. Atlas is built to be extensible, each build system implements a generic worker interface.</p>
<p>Atlas has been indispensable in development at Hootsuite, assisting in onboarding new developers, diagnosing bugs, and much more. I am very excited to finally Open Source the tool as a Kotlin/JS project and to dive deep into it for KotlinConf attendees so that they can use it in their own projects or even extend it to new build systems.</p>
<p>Peon<br>Peon was written because the Android team at Hootsuite was tired of bumping versions of libraries, both internal and external, and then cascading those changes up a dependency graph. Peon takes the dependency graph output of Atlas and then makes changes to the graph in an intelligent, and topologically aware, manner. Peon was also originally implemented in Ruby but is currently being rewritten in Kotlin/JS.</p>
<p>Peon takes in a list of libraries to be updated in the graph. You can use it to update the version of Kotlin in all our projects or to bump a version of an external library. You can also use it to propagate changes to an internal library to the rest of the graph.</p>
<p>Since deploying it at Hootsuite, Peon has saved hundred of developer hours. Peon will be released as an Open Source Kotlin/JS project prior to KotlinConf so that we can dive deep into this tool and attendees can integrate it with their own workflows.</p>
<p>I am very excited to lead this talk, diving deep into both of these tools which are used daily at Hootsuite. I am especially interested in sharing the project with others so that they can save time on their own projects and teams.</p>
<p>I am also interested in sharing my experience with Kotlin/JS, especially converting a Ruby project to Kotlin/JS. The benefits of the Kotlin type system for example, were immediately apparent, both within the project and when integrating with other Javascript libraries.</p>
<p>About the Presenter:<br>Neil Power is a Software Developer at Hootsuite, building out Hootsuite’s Platform. He was previously an Android Developer working on Hootsuite’s Android application. Originally from Newfoundland, he now calls Vancouver home. On the Hootsuite Android team, he made the switch to Kotlin early in 2016 and hasn’t looked back.</p>

<p>Recording brought to you by American Express <a href="https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://americanexpress.io/kotlin-jobs</a><br>As programmers, we love solving problems. However, sometimes we need more than programmer grit to solve many problems with no easy answer. Suppose you need to tightly schedule 190 classes in 20 classrooms, with different class durations, recurrences, and constraints throughout the week? What about minimizing the operating cost of a train schedule while maintaining a steady movement of passengers? How about anticipating an industry competitor’s move? Or simply solving a Sudoku?</p>
<p>Mathematical modeling is the workhorse of data science, machine learning, and operations research. By effectively expressing mathematical concepts in code, you can gracefully find solutions to a broad category of problems and avoid impractical brute-force techniques. Even better, Kotlin’s pragmatic language features allow clearer and more refactorable models that can safely evolve and be put in production.</p>
<p>Come to this session to see live examples of Kotlin mathematical models to solve real-world problems like discrete optimization, Bayesian techniques, and artificial neural networks.</p>
<p>About the Presenter:<br>Thomas Nield is a Business Consultant at Southwest Airlines, often balancing technology with operations research. He is also an author and trainer with O’Reilly Media. He wrote two books (“Getting Started with SQL” and “Learning RxJava”) and regularly contributes to OSS projects.</p>
